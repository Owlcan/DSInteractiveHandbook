      	 <p>Before you can battle dragons (or maybe just very grumpy dust bunnies), there are a few things every Diaper School student needs:</p>
      	 <ul>
        	 <li><strong>Our Clubhouse: Discord!</strong> All our games, chats, and super-secret plans happen on Discord! It's like our magical treehouse, but with more dice and fewer splinters. Make sure you've joined our server to get all the latest news and find friends for your quests! <a href="[Link to Your Awesome Discord Server Here!]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Link to Your Awesome Discord Server Here!]</a></li>
        	 <li><strong>Your Hero Storybook: Character Sheets!</strong> Every brave adventurer needs a storybook that tells everyone how amazing they are! This is your character sheet. You can make one using:
          	 <ul>
            	 <li><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D&D Beyond</a>: It's super easy, like coloring by numbers, and helps you keep track of all your cool powers!</li>
            	 <li>Our Special <a href="[Link to Your GSheet Template Here]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheet Template</a>: This is another magic scroll that helps you build your hero!</li>
          	 </ul>
          	 Both are fantastic for showing off your character!
        	 </li>
        	 <li><strong>Knowing Your D&D ABCs!</strong> We hope our little scholars have a little bit of D&D know-how – like what an Ability score is, how to be Brave in a fight, and the basics of Casting spells! If you're brand new to the big world of Dungeons & Dragons, think of it like learning how to use your building blocks before making a giant castle. Don't worry, there are lots of friendly grown-ups (Admins) and older students who are happy to help you learn the ropes!</li>

    	 <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
      	 <p>Sometimes, the bestest heroes are the ones you dream up all by yourself, with sparkly powers and cool outfits not found in the regular storybooks! This is called "homebrew," and it's like inventing your own super-duper flavor of ice cream!</p>
      	 <p>If you're using homebrew bits like a special race (maybe you're a Fluffy Cloud Kitten!) or a new class (like a Crayon Knight of Justice!), our grown-up helpers (Admins) need to give it a big thumbs up first. But don't fret! Making your character sheet can be as easy as 1-2-3-4 with a friendly robot helper (that's an AI Assistant!).</p>
      	 <ol>
        	 <li><strong>Gather Your Sparkles!</strong> Collect all your notes, drawings, and ideas about your homebrew race, class, and any other special bits you want. It's like gathering all your favorite crayons and glitter before making a masterpiece!</li>
        	 <li><strong>Tell the Robot Helper!</strong> Find your favorite AI assistant (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another one – ask a grown-up if you need help finding one!). Show it all your notes. You can copy-paste the text or even upload files if your robot helper is extra smart!</li>
        	 <li><strong>The Magic Words!</strong> Tell your robot helper this very special instruction. It's like a secret password to unlock a treasure chest of character creation!

The character needs to have both the 2024 background option (which includes a feat and an Ability Score Increase - ASI) AND their normal racial ASI. Use the 27 point-buy method for ability scores, and make sure they have maximized Hit Points (HP) at every level. Please provide the character sheet in a document format if you can!</code>

      	 <p>Imagine telling a super exciting story with your friends, but instead of talking out loud, you write it all down! That's "Play by Post" (or PbP for short). It's like passing secret notes in class, but with more dragons, fewer detentions, and definitely more diapers!</p>
      	 <p>We use our Discord clubhouse for PbP games. Because Discord is super speedy like a race car, our stories can zoom along much faster than old-fashioned forums, which were more like slow, sleepy snails. You can post when you have a moment – maybe during snack time, after school, or before bed – and the adventure keeps unfolding, one exciting message at a time!</p>

    	 <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
      	 <p>Even in a world filled with magic, monsters, and mountains of plushies, we all need to be good friends to each other. That's what roleplay etiquette is all about! It’s like sharing your toys, taking turns on the slide, and not throwing sand (unless it’s magic sand, and everyone agrees it’s okay!).</p>
      	 <ul>
        	 <li><strong>Remember the Code!</strong> Our Student Code of Conduct (you can find it on page 10 of the main handbook, little ones!) is super important. Being respectful, not cheating (that’s a big no-no!), and making sure everyone feels safe and happy are the golden rules of Diaper School.</li>
        	 <li><strong>Think Before You Type!</strong> Before you post what your hero does or says, take a tiny pause. Is your character being kind (even if they're a grumpy barbarian)? Are you helping the story be fun for *everyone*? Teamwork makes the dream work, even when you're fighting giggling goblins!</li>
        	 <li><strong>No Peeking! (Metagaming)</strong> Don't use grown-up knowledge that your little hero wouldn't actually know in the game. That's called "metagaming," and it's like peeking at someone else's drawing before they shout "Ta-da!"</li>
        	 <li><strong>Consent is Cool!</strong> This is a big one, especially for things like punishments or certain types of roleplay (we talk about this on page 15 of the main handbook). Always make sure your playmates are comfy and having just as much fun as you are. If someone says "stop" or "I'm not comfortable," we listen!</li>

        	 <li><strong>Waving Your Wand (Magic!):</strong> Spells are like special instructions you give to the world, using funny words, wiggly hand gestures, or even sparkly dust! When you want your hero to cast a spell, describe what they do and say. Then, you'll use Avrae to see if your magic works its wonders. Remember, some spells need special bits and bobs (components)!</li>

                <p>No, while required for enrollment as a means of ensuring a player is somewhat committed to the idea of play, using your stats and skills is NOT required in non-combat/technical scenes. If you're just spending time in the cafeteria or common areas, checks not-related to potty-stuff are completely optional in most circumstances. This is Diaper School, so learning AT LEAST how to roll a constitution check is probably a good idea- the bot will do it for you, so learning <code>!c con</code> shouldn't be too much!</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Many diapers, especially magical ones, have a certain number of "Use Charges." These represent how many incidents (wetting or messing) the diaper can handle before it's considered fully used or its magical properties are depleted.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "CONTINENCE (CON) CHECK CHART" (Handbook, p. 9) details how many charges are consumed based on the severity of an incident (e.g., a "Complete Loss of Control" might use 3 charges on a magical diaper, while a "Slightly Wet" might use 1).</li>
                    <li>Standard institutional diapers provided to students offer 4 Use Charges. (Answer to "Where do I get diapers?!")</li>
                    <li>"DA BIG DIAPER CHART" (Handbook, p. 66) lists specific use charges for various types of mundane and magical diapers. For example, a "Pullup" has 1 Use*, while a "Heroic MagiDiaper" has 10 Uses*.</li>
                    <li>Once all use charges are expended, a magical diaper might lose its magical properties and function as a mundane (and likely full) diaper. A mundane diaper with charges is simply considered full.</li>
                    <li>Boosters can add extra use charges to a diaper (Handbook, p. 66).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Always refer to the specific diaper's description or the "DA BIG DIAPER CHART" for its exact number of use charges and how incidents affect them.</p>

You do not have to enjoy it, you do not have to describe it in ways that disgust you, and you don't need to go out of your way to describe it, but it may occur! Just go get changed. When playing with others, you MUST pre-discuss your intended mechanical desires if you expect them to be accommodated. (Handbook, p. 15)</p>

                <p>This usually means player time (IRL days). For example, "two weeks in diapers" means two IRL weeks. Disappearing to avoid punishment time is considered poor form. If your character is in a situation where in-game time passes differently (e.g., a dungeon taking 4 IRL days but only 1 in-game day), the IRL punishment duration still applies, but your character serves the in-game equivalent.

                    <li><strong>Tantrum Tinkerer (Diaper School Edition):</strong> Casting artificer spells risks triggering a "Wild Magic Tantrum" from a specific table, causing unpredictable (often messy or baby-themed) effects. (Handbook, p. 140, uses Wild Magic Tantrum table on p. 134)</li>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>No, not necessarily. As long as the student roleplays going to the Infirmary (or a pre-approved staff character/PC who has agreed to let their character handle these off-time actions) to seek a change, they will normally be given such a luxury. The key is the roleplayed attempt to seek appropriate help.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>No, not in an OOC (Out Of Character) sense. "In player time" means the punishment's duration is tied to real-world days of play, not strictly in-game days. For example, a "seven-day diaper punishment" means your character is considered under that punishment for seven days during which you are actively playing or present in the game. The purpose is to ensure players are present and accountable for the duration of their character's punishment and can't simply disappear OOC for a week to have their character return unpunished. Your character remains under the effects of the punishment in-game for that period.</p>

                <p>The "Unexploded Regression Bomb" (p. 53) and "Old-War Regression Mine" (p. 53) specify physical stats are reduced to 8, movement to 10, and size becomes small, but intellectual skills are unaffected. The "Big Babification" spell (p. 84) causes broader effects including mental regression (disadvantage on INT/WIS saves) and impacts to potty checks. For other forms of regression (e.g., from "Babybrain" spell p. 75, or "Personal Littlespace" p. 75), refer to the specific spell/effect description. Generally, unless an effect states otherwise, core class abilities might become difficult or impossible to use effectively if the regression is significant, subject to GM discretion based on the new form's limitations.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>The "Da Big Diaper Chart" (p. 66) doesn't explicitly list sizes for Large creatures. However, magical diapers often resize (e.g., "Diaper of the Hyena's Riddle" p. 57, "Padding Swap" p. 80). It's assumed the Academy can procure or magically create diapers suitable for all its students, including Large ones. Mundane diapers might be specially ordered or require multiple standard ones. This would be a good point for GM discretion or a specific ruling if it becomes a frequent issue.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>The "Produce Milk" ability (p. 93) states the milk is "fully nutritious" and "bolsters vitality," allowing creatures to regain 1d4 hit points. It doesn't inherently suggest it's a "potent substance" in the negative sense that would trigger a Continence Check like spoiled rations or disruptive potions (p. 12). However, a creative player or GM might explore scenarios where an excessive amount or magically altered version could have unintended digestive consequences. Standard use is beneficial.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p><strong>Pacification:</strong> This spell restricts speech and muffles the voice. It doesn't directly mention affecting continence. However, the general theme of infantile items might lead to roleplay scenarios or GM rulings where a pacified individual might be treated more like a younger child, potentially leading to more frequent checks or assumptions about their needs.</p>
                <p><strong>Babybrain:</strong> This spell clouds the mind with "infantile simplicity," reduces movement, and limits actions. While not explicitly stating an effect on continence, the significant mental impairment could reasonably lead to a GM ruling that the character has less control or awareness, making them more prone to accidents or requiring Continence Checks at a lower threshold or with disadvantage. The "Big Babification" spell (p. 84), which is a more severe transformation, explicitly states disadvantage on potty checks.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>"Willing" in this context likely refers to the <em>other</em> creature's consent to the sexual act itself, independent of the wearer's ability to experience physical pleasure from it. The curse is on the wearer; the other participant must still genuinely agree to the encounter. The challenge for the wearer is to achieve this seduction (DC 18 Charisma check) despite their own sensory deprivation and the inherent awkwardness of the situation. The focus is on the act of seduction and consensual participation from the partner, not necessarily mutual physical gratification.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>"Lethal magic" likely refers to spells or abilities that are inherently designed to kill or cause grievous bodily harm, even if the campus wards convert direct damage to subdual. For example, a spell like <em>Power Word Kill</em> or a high-level <em>Disintegrate</em> would still be considered lethal in intent and use, even if the wards prevent the finality of death. AoE spells that could cause significant, dangerous environmental destruction (e.g., a massive <em>Earthquake</em> spell that collapses a building) could also fall under this, as the intent isn't subdual. This is an area where GM interpretation of intent and potential consequences would be key. The rule aims to prevent students from using magic designed to kill, regardless of campus safeguards.</p>

                <p>"Formless Passage" allows movement through non-magical objects, doors, or walls. A standard, mundane locked diaper might be passable. However, many punitive or cursed diapers in this setting are explicitly magical (e.g., "Locking Diapers" p. 14 are "always magical," "Clothen Pamprison" p. 56 is enchanted). If the diaper is magical or magically locked (as many in this setting are implied to be, especially punitive ones), "Formless Passage" would likely not work as it specifies "non-magical objects" and "does not work on magically locked or sealed areas."</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Diaper-Mastery:</strong> If a Seimei somehow acquired the Incontinent trait (which is a prerequisite for Diaper-Mastery, and Seimei are not listed as naturally qualifying like Cowbuddies or Skunkiddos), their Demi-Incontinence would still impose disadvantage on the Continence Checks themselves, even if Diaper-Mastery mitigates some penalties of <em>being</em> messy. The Relief Bonus from Diaper-Mastery (rolling a 1 or filling without leaking) might still apply if those conditions are met despite the disadvantage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spells Affecting Continence:</strong> Spells like "Uncrinkling Catastrophe" (p. 70) that force a potty check would still apply, and the Seimei would roll that check with disadvantage if they've overconsumed human food. Spells that <em>cause</em> incontinence (like "Curse of Incontinence" p. 54) would make them fully incontinent, and their Demi-Incontinence disadvantage would apply to any subsequent checks related to the severity or control of that incontinence.</li>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Welcome! We're excited to have you. The "How to Play: Naptime Adventures!" section earlier in this handbook is a great place to start. It covers getting on Discord, character sheets, and the very basics of D&D. Don't worry if it seems like a lot; many students and staff are happy to help new players. The core idea is to tell a story together and have fun. The D&D Player's Handbook is the ultimate guide, but you don't need to read it all at once. Focus on understanding your character's abilities and how to make basic rolls first.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Subdual damage is still damage. So, if your Barbarian takes subdual damage while raging, it would still count as taking damage for the purpose of maintaining rage. Similarly, if a spellcaster takes subdual damage, they would still need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, just as if it were lethal damage. The main difference with subdual damage on campus is that it won't kill you outright but can still knock you unconscious and has tactical implications.</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>This is a nuanced interaction. "Bulky Training Diapers" (p. 8) are described as "extra thick and noticeable, potentially used to emphasize a student's regressed state or as a disciplinary measure, often imposing disadvantage on Stealth checks due to noise and bulk." "Diaper-Mastery" (p. 10) states, "In combat, aside from suffering the effects of a Leaking Diaper, you are no longer penalized by a full or messy diaper."</p>
                <p>If the "Bulky Training Diaper" is also "full" or "messy," Diaper-Mastery's combat adaptation <em>should</em> negate any penalties specifically arising from its fullness or messiness (like the movement speed reduction associated with a standard "Full Diaper" state, p.10). However, if the disadvantage on Stealth from Bulky Training Diapers is due to their inherent size, noise, and visual obviousness *regardless* of how full they are, Diaper-Mastery might not negate that specific Stealth penalty, as it's a property of the diaper type itself, not just its current state of use. The GM would make the final call based on the specific circumstances and whether the penalty is tied to fullness or inherent bulk/noise.</p>

        <h3>Pre Old-War Period</h3>
        <div class="lore-content">
          <p><strong>~1000 Years Ago:</strong> Academy Plane is established by the enigmatic figure known only as The Headmaster.</p>
          <p><strong>~900 Years Ago:</strong> The Headmaster teaches his first class, "Practical Adventuring." The class is so overbooked that the backlog to attend is estimated to be ~890 years long.</p>
          <p><strong>~850 Years Ago:</strong> The Headmaster disappears from everyday life amongst the Academy. Somehow, he continues to teach his classes as usual. In time, students forget they even take the class despite it appearing on their rosters and their earning of credits towards the class. Some students claim memories from these sessions with a Professor Hoots, but many dismiss these claims as some illusory trick of the Academy's latent magics.</p>

          <p><strong>~800 Years Ago:</strong> Sorceress Tabitha enrolls at the Academy at the age of 12, an orphan from a devastated and erased realm.</p>
          <p><strong>~770 Years Ago:</strong> Tabitha creates The Well of the Blessed Engine, a device she claims will allow her to save souls from outside the realm.</p>
          <p><strong>710-708 Years Ago:</strong> Sorceress Tabitha unleashes the true intent of the Well of Souls. Despite claiming it had never been turned on to full power to save the souls of those who died on other planes without some way to preserve the sanctity of their spirit, the device had been collecting and storing souls for almost a century. Using this power, Tabitha creates the first of her Warforged Host.</p>
          <p><strong>~707-705 Years Ago:</strong> Using the power of the Well and her Warforged Host, Tabitha wrests control of the Academy from The Council of Professorial Oversight which had taken over for the Headmaster after his sudden ontological dysfunction became apparent. Her pataphysical control over the Academic Plane becomes so strong that she is able to eject students and staff that pose any sort of threat to her hegemony.</p>
          <p>Tabitha begins to recruit students not simply for the purpose of training but to harvest the failures for conversion into a part of her Warforged Host.</p>

Hundreds, if not thousands, die within the first few days of fighting in the small demiplane.</p>
          <p><strong>704 Years Ago:</strong> Pliya and dozens of other students are killed during the events of the First Internal Siege. Warforged emerge from beneath the school and ravage the campus- held back by bulwarks of remaining magical wards and the efforts of valiant students and staff who turn back the initial tide. Tabitha, Acting Headmistress, disappears from public view when scrutiny falls on her after the attack is repelled.</p>

          <p><strong>703 Years Ago:</strong> Magiana and Lesser Radiana are consumed in magical fire and etheric nuclear flame as the Dragons of Monacalath are seen flying overhead in their first war formation in 200 years. They send message that this is a warning for the Academy to surrender to Tabitha's entourage. However, in burning the only lesser-protected spaces outside the grounds, Tabitha had also torched her own auspices of negotiation- war was now absolute and armies would march at The First Battle of the Gate in this year- Tabitha's armies, led by Monacalath the Dragon Lord and Sylane the Sister-Witch of the Sorceress, and the Scholian Forces led by Galander Forsythe and Ylva of the Circle of the Academy.</p>
          <p>After weeks of slamming their forms against the Bulwark of the Gate, the Battle at the Doors takes place in the later days of this year. For a second time, Monacalath and Sylane are turned back from the Academy grounds they had once called home. The cost, Avatar of the Headmaster and another hero of the age are said to have held aloft the original doors of the school, using them as weapon and aegis against the foes of the Warforged Host.</p>
          <p>At the Apex of Planar Power on The Eve of the New Year, The Mountains Mordest are levelled in an act of revenge after the loss of Galander Forsythe, Leader of Scholia Armies. Ylva made a pact with the spirits of nature bound to the Academy plane to destroy the mountains, dropping them into the planar void.</p>
          <p><strong>702 Years Ago:</strong> The Day the Mountains Tumbled results in the near-total annihilation of the Renegade Remnant of students under Tabitha, as well as eliminating most of The Training Fortress, which had been converted into The Ebony Echelon by Tabitha's forces.</p>
          <p>The Iron March Begins as The Longest of Wintertide begins. Using Spatial Distortion magic fuelled by a last-ditch effort to tap the Well of Souls to defend against Tabitha, the Planar Demesne is drastically elongated in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The tension and stress of this action claims the lives of the entire Scholia Psionica and would mark the end of those studies at the Academy for almost 650 years.</p>

          <p><strong>~680 Years Prior:</strong> The Academy, its reputation besmirched by the dark shadow of conflict, saw a dramatic decline in enrollment. In response, the Council broadened its admissions criteria, inviting pupils of diverse and unconventional backgrounds to walk its storied halls.</p>
          <p><strong>~650 Years Prior:</strong> The Great Library of Scholia, a bastion of erudition and the epicenter of academic endeavor, arose from the ashes of the past. It was enshrouded by an enchanted barrier, impermeable to those whose intentions were not pure.</p>

          <p><strong>~600 Years Prior:</strong> The Second Internal Siege of Scholia Proper was discovered as the Council unearthed a clandestine chamber within the Great Library, serving as the nexus of the Shadow Guild's operations. The ensuing battle cleansed the School of this malicious presence. After the battle, the first sightings of darklings outside the walls of the school is reported. Early darklings are largely formless and pose little threat to anyone.</p>
          <p><strong>~580 Years Prior:</strong> In the wake of the Old War, the Academy introduced a novel curriculum centered on the study and safeguarding of ancient artifacts, recognizing the dual nature of power in the hands of the unenlightened.</p>

          <p><strong>~280 Years Prior:</strong> The Outreach, a satellite campus of the Scholia Magus Academy, was established in the Material Plane, offering the fruits of knowledge to those unable to partake in the Planar Campus's ethereal embrace.</p>
          <p><strong>~250 Years Prior:</strong> The "Incontinence Incident," a regrettable prank gone awry, cast an embarrassing pall over the School. The ensuing hilarity and confusion, however, did little to deter the student body's resolve.</p>
          <p><strong>~230 Years Prior:</strong> The Council of Professorial Oversight was infiltrated by the descendants of the Shadow Guild. The Diapered Whisperer, a mole of insidious intent, began subtly shaping the Academy's destiny.</p>
          <p><strong>~200 Years Prior:</strong> The "Water War," a magical conflagration precipitated by a student's experiment, led to the temporary closure of the School of Elementalism for renovations.</p>

        <h3>Recent Historical Milestones</h3>
        <div class="lore-content">
          <p><strong>~155 Years Prior:</strong> The era saw the enrollment of several current luminaries of the Academy's faculty, including the esteemed Ardelie Heller.</p>
          <p><strong>~150 Years Prior:</strong> The Diapered Defenders reunited to confront the emergent menace of "The Infantilizer," whose insidious power sought to diminish the great to the state of the powerless.</p>
          <p><strong>~130 Years Prior:</strong> The enigmatic Ghostly Host materialized before the eyes of the School's denizens, their spectral presence a silent sentinel and a poignant reminder of the Academy's storied past.</p>

        <div class="lore-content">
          <p><strong>~120 Years Prior:</strong> The Infantilizer was vanquished, though not before leaving a trail of diapered dignitaries in his wake. The Diapered Defenders, having served their purpose, once again dispersed into the annals of history.</p>
          <p><strong>~100 Years Prior:</strong> The millennial anniversary of the Academy's founding was celebrated with the Grand Quest, a series of trials to test the mettle of its pupils and reaffirm its legacy of heroism.</p>
          <p><strong>~90 Years Prior:</strong> The Ghostly Host was revealed to be an unintended consequence of the Headmaster's efforts to shield the School. Their existence served as a haunting reminder of the interplay between protection and confinement.</p>
