                            <p>Skunkiddos are small, nimble humanoids that resemble anthropomorphic skunks. Their distinctive black and white striped fur patterns make them immediately recognizable, with most featuring a prominent white stripe running from head to tail. Skunkiddos typically stand between <strong>2'6" and 3'2"</strong> tall, with slender builds and expressive faces. Their most notable feature is their fluffy tail, which they often use for balance during their impressive climbing feats.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Description</h3>
                        <p>Native to the mysterious DS Plane, Skunkiddos are known for their mischievous personalities and unabashed approach to life. They form tight-knit communities where pranks and playful antics are cultural norms rather than exceptions. Having eschewed certain social conventions like potty training, most Skunkiddos are naturally incontinent and wear protective garments as a matter of course. This quirk is viewed not as a drawback but as part of their carefree nature that lets them focus on adventure and exploration without interruption.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Skunkiddo Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Skunkiddo character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Skunkiddos are naturally <strong>Small</strong> creatures, though some may border on small-medium.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>25 feet</strong>.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dig Speed:</strong> You have a burrow (dig) speed of 5 feet, allowing you to tunnel through loose earth or sand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Climb Speed:</strong> You have a climb speed of 10 feet.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Stink Spray.</strong> As an action, you can exhale a repulsive cloud of odor in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be poisoned and sickened until the end of your next turn. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
                        <p><strong>Diapered Instinct.</strong> Having eschewed potty training on the DS Plane, you are naturally incontinent at creation. Because of this inherent flaw, you are eligible to select the <strong>Diaper-Mastery</strong> feat at character creation in lieu of meeting its usual prerequisites.</p>
                        <p><strong>Keen Senses.</strong> You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on your sense of smell.</p>
                        <p><strong>Mischievous Nature.</strong> Your wily personality grants you proficiency in the <strong>Stealth</strong> skill.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and <strong>Skunkiddo</strong>—a guttural, expressive language mixed with chirps, barks, and the occasional odoriferous exclamation.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <p>Skunkiddos are as notorious for their potent stench as they are for their boundless mischief. Whether burrowing beneath the earth or scaling vertical surfaces with ease, these cheeky natives of the DS Plane leave their mark—often well before their foes can even react.</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Intelligence</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfume Poof.</strong> You replace the standard Skunkiddo Stink Spray with a burst of heady, magical fragrance. As an action, you can exude a pleasant perfume in a 15‑foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be overwhelmed:
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Enemies</strong> become dazzled—taking disadvantage on their next attack roll or ability check before the start of your next turn.</li>
                            <li><strong>Allies</strong> in the area feel inspired, gaining temporary morale (choose a benefit such as advantage on a single ability check or saving throw until the start of your next turn).</li>
                            </ul>
                            You can use Perfume Poof a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses after a long rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fragrant Magic.</strong> Your innate magical flair allows you to learn one arcane cantrip of your choice. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</li>

                        <li><strong>Enhanced Stink Spray.</strong> True to your aggressive nature, your natural stink spray is particularly potent. When you use your Stink Spray (as provided in the base race), affected creatures on a failed Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) suffer the usual poisoned condition until the end of your next turn <strong>and</strong> become frightened of you for 1 round. On a successful save, a creature takes half the duration effect (they are only poisoned).</li>
                        <li><strong>Unbridled Momentum.</strong> Your raw aggression and determination drive you forward. Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Battle-Hardened Aroma.</strong> While your aroma might repel most, it fuels your fierce spirit. You gain proficiency in the <strong>Intimidation</strong> skill if you do not already have it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Brutal Presence.</strong> Your imposing, malodorous aura makes your foes think twice before engaging you, perfectly accentuating the wild and unrefined nature of your kind.</li>

                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>Darklings are humanoid beings composed of living shadows and darkness given form. Their bodies appear as silhouettes with vague humanoid features, often shifting and rippling like moving shadows. Their eyes glow with an inner light—typically amber, violet, or pale blue—providing the only consistent feature in their otherwise morphic forms. They can compress or expand their shadowy forms at will, temporarily altering their size from small to large.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Cultural Description</h3>
                        <p>Darklings exist in the boundaries between light and darkness, often dwelling in twilight realms or deep, ancient forests. Their society values adaptability, stealth, and harmony with shadow energies. Many serve as guardians of forgotten places or as scouts for other civilizations due to their natural affinity for darkness and shadow travel. Though sometimes mistaken for beings of evil intent due to their appearance, Darklings span all moral alignments and often demonstrate surprising compassion.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Darkling Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Darkling character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Scent.</strong> You can track creatures around you by scent within a defined radius, treated as blindsense.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tendril Lash.</strong> Your natural shadow-lash weapon can strike foes with concentrated shadow energy. This attack deals <strong>1d4 damage</strong> instead of the standard unarmed strike damage of 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Umbral Jaunt.</strong> You can use shadowed ethereal movement to teleport to any unoccupied space within 20 feet. If you are assuming a small size, you may end your teleport in the same square as another creature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Shadow Regeneration.</strong> When not wounded in battle, you can heal yourself over time. If unwounded for 1 round, you begin to coalesce your being back together. Every round after the first round you are not wounded, you restore <strong>1d6 HP</strong> provided you do not move more than 10 ft in that turn. <em>Umbral Jaunt</em> does not count as movement for the purposes of this feature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Nightling Mind and Body.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>You take <strong>double damage</strong> from sources of radiant damage due to the fact that light energy disrupts your shadow form.</li>
                        <li>You don't sleep; instead you <strong>lurk</strong>—similar to elven meditation—for 4–6 hours.</li>
                        <li>You <strong>cannot be frightened</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Body of Vapor.</strong> As an action up to <strong>3 times per day</strong>, you can compress or expand your body to have either the <em>Giant Might</em> or <em>Shadow's Child</em> effects for 1 minute. You must complete a short rest between uses.</p>
                        <p><strong>Giant Might:</strong> You magically gain the following benefits:
                        <ul>
                        <li>If you are smaller than Large, you become <strong>Large</strong>, along with anything you are wearing. If you lack the room to become Large, your size doesn't change.</li>
                        <li>You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
                        <li>Your weapon attacks deal an extra <strong>1d6 damage</strong>.</li>

                        <p><strong>Aggressive.</strong> As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this move closer to the enemy than you started.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, and understand Undercommon.</p>

                        <li><strong>Transmorphic Affinity.</strong> Your attunement to shadowy transformation grants you an <strong>additional use</strong> of <em>Body of Vapor</em> per long rest.

                            <p>Seimei appear as humanoids whose very essence is intertwined with nature. Their skin carries subtle hints of green and earthen hues, often marked with leaf-like patterns that change with the seasons. Many have hair that blossoms into delicate flowers or trails of vine, emphasizing their organic nature. Treebearers tend toward a taller, more muscular build, while Floralfolk are lithe and graceful.</p>

                        <p>Living in harmony with sunlit groves and ancient woodlands, the Seimei derive sustenance from sunlight. They require only 4–6 hours of direct sunlight (or broad-spectrum UV exposure) each day in lieu of conventional food. With 8 or more hours of sunlight, they need not sleep; otherwise, they require a 4‑hour dormancy period, similar to elven rest. Ageless by nature, they commonly live into the thousands unless altered by epic heroism or dark destiny. However, their digestive design means they rarely void unless they overconsume human foods—rendering them demi-incontinent and subject to disadvantage on any bowel or "brown-note" effects.</p>

                        <h3>Seimei Racial Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Seimei character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by 2.</p>
                        <p><strong>Photosynthetic Sustenance.</strong> You do not require traditional food as long as you receive 4–6 hours of direct sunlight (or broad-spectrum UV) daily.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solar Slumber.</strong> With 8+ hours of sunlight every day, you need not sleep. Otherwise, you must enter a 4‑hour dormancy cycle (similar to elves).</p>
                        <p><strong>Demi-Incontinence.</strong> Overindulgence in human foods causes you to suffer disadvantage on any effects or rolls related to bowel/brown-note influences.</p>
                        <p><strong>Legacy Bearer.</strong> When you wield a legacy weapon, it gains an extra feature-attunement slot. This benefit applies to up to two legacy weapons at one time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Weapon Proficiency.</strong> You are proficient with rapiers, katanas, fullblades, and all forms of daggers. Any dagger-like weapon lacking a throwing range gains one (10 feet).</p>
                        <p><strong>Tool Proficiency.</strong> Choose one: thieves' tools, calligrapher's tools, or cartographer's tools.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ageless.</strong> Seimei age extremely slowly, often living for thousands of years unless fate intervenes.</p>

                        <h3>Ghost Traits and Subrace Mechanics</h3>
                        <p>A Ghost character starts with the Ghost's unique racial traits and supplements them with traits from their original "living" race, reflecting the remnants of their mortal life. This combination creates a spectral version of their original race with added abilities tied to their incorporeal nature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Racial Features:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1, and your <strong>Intelligence</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Size.</strong> Ghosts retain the size of their original race (e.g., Small or Medium).</li>
                        <li><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>, unless your original race grants a higher walking speed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sleepless Spectre.</strong> You do not need to sleep. Instead, you enter a semi-dormant state for 4 hours, akin to elven meditation. During this time, you are fully aware of your surroundings. You are also immune to charm effects that rely on sleep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in darkness within <strong>60 feet</strong> as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</li>
                        <li><strong>Formless Passage.</strong> Twice per long rest, you can assume an incorporeal form for up to <strong>10 minutes</strong>. While incorporeal, you can move through non-magical objects, doors, or walls as if they were difficult terrain. You cannot end your turn inside a solid object. This ability does not work on magically locked or sealed areas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spectral Manipulation.</strong> You can cast the <strong>mage hand</strong> cantrip a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wail of the Lost.</strong> As an action, you can release an otherworldly wail. Each creature within <strong>10 feet</strong> that can hear you must succeed on a <strong>Wisdom saving throw</strong> (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be <strong>frightened</strong> of you for 1 minute. Creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. You can use this ability once per long rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ethereal Insight.</strong> Gain proficiency in <strong>Arcana</strong> and <strong>Religion</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and one additional language of your choice.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Ghost Subraces</h3>
                        <p><strong>Ghost subraces</strong> are unique in that they combine the traits of your original "living" race with the spectral abilities of the Ghost race. Rather than replacing features, you layer the essence of your mortal past onto the Ghost template.</p>
                        <h5>To create a Ghost subrace:</h5>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Start with the Ghost race as your base.</strong> Use its ability score increases, racial traits, and abilities as your foundation.</li>

                        <p>The Morphian Changeling is an advanced offshoot of the typical changeling, possessing an unparalleled ability to adapt their form to mirror the physiology of other races. They maintain the flexibility and charisma of their changeling heritage, while boasting transformative powers far beyond what most changelings can achieve.</p>

                            <h3>Morphian Traits</h3>
                            <p>As a Morphian Changeling, you have the following racial traits.</p>
                            <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.</p>
                            <p><strong>Age.</strong> Morphians mature at the same rate as changelings and live to be around 120 years old.</p>
                            <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Morphians, like changelings, tend toward chaotic alignments due to their adaptable nature.</p>
                            <p><strong>Size.</strong> Morphians are Medium, though they may transform into Small creatures when mimicking other races.</p>
                            <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
                            <p><strong>Robust Transformation.</strong> As a Morphian, you can transform into any Medium or Small-sized race you have previously touched with bare skin. This transformation requires a 12-hour biological process that functions as a trance-like sleep, during which you alter your racial phylogeny. Once this process is complete, you gain all of the racial traits, abilities, and proficiencies of the chosen race as if applying a subrace to your character. Note that the base Morphian traits are considered the "subrace" for this purpose.</p>
                            <p><strong>Form Limitations.</strong> While temporarily disguising yourself using your standard changeling transformation ability, you can only mimic races you have touched but do not gain the racial abilities or powers of a race other than your current chosen form. This makes your disguise purely aesthetic in nature unless it matches your active "subrace."</p>
                            <p><strong>Temporary Transformation.</strong> As an action, you can temporarily transform to take on the physical appearance of a race you have touched. This transformation lasts up to 1 hour or until you revert to your original form (no action required). You cannot gain the racial traits, powers, or abilities of a race different from your current chosen form.</p>
                            <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common, two other languages of your choice, and any racial language you acquire through a chosen form.</p>
                            <p><strong>Subrace Selection.</strong> Your subrace is determined by the race you last transformed into using your <strong>Robust Transformation</strong> ability. You must complete the 12-hour transformation process to change subraces.</p>

                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Transformation Mechanics</h3>
                        <p>To use <strong>Robust Transformation</strong>, you must have physically touched a member of a race with bare skin at least once before attempting to emulate that race. You may only have one active chosen form at a time. When in your chosen form, you are treated as a member of that race for all effects that apply based on race (e.g., racial abilities, magical affinities).</p>
                        <p>If you wish to transform into a new race, you must complete the 12-hour process to adjust your racial phylogeny. This involves a trance-like state during which your Morphian biology adapts to mimic the race in question.</p>

Some serve as diplomats and merchants, while others pursue scholarly endeavors or master the blend of magic with martial prowess. Many Tanukijin revel in the thrill of misdirection and jest, while a select few delve deep into the arcane arts.

Demi-Gorgons are touched by legends, but they're still figuring out how to tie their own divine shoelaces (if they even wear shoes, that is). They might look mostly like other little students at first glance, but give it a second, and you'll spot the signs: maybe it's the way their hair wiggles on its own, or how time seems to get a bit wobbly when they're throwing a tantrum, or perhaps they're just, y'know, <em>really</em> good at knocking over block towers.</p>

But hey, being a little monstrous just means you've got more interesting ways to play (and maybe get out of naptime).</p>

                            <h4><strong>Not *That* Kind of Gorgon!:</strong></h4>
                            <p>Now, don't get your nappies in a twist. "Demi-Gorgon" is just a fancy term. We're not talking about those big, scary, turn-you-to-stone ladies all the time. Well, not *all* the time. It's more like... you've got a little bit of their oomph, mixed with a healthy dose of "still needs a juice box and a nap".</p>

                        <h3>Demi-Gorgon Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Demi-Gorgon character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age.</strong> Demi-Gorgons grow up at about the same pace as humans, but their mythic mojo means they can stick around for a couple of centuries. How old they *look* can be a whole other story, especially for certain... types.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Like any kiddo, Demi-Gorgons can be sweet as pie or a total handful. They lean towards the alignment of whatever mythic being gave them their spark, but the Academy (and maybe a few too many sugar rushes) can steer them any which way. Usually, they're too busy causing adorable chaos to be truly Evil.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Demi-Gorgons are <strong>Medium</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monstrous Nature.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and one additional language that makes sense for your mythic background (e.g., Primordial, Celestial, Abyssal – discuss with your DM).</p>

                            <p class="subrace-description">Snaked-haired little brats whose snake hair has unique abilities that make up for their natural lack of charm (and maybe their tendency to accidentally trip people with their head-squiggles).</p>

                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by 2, but your <strong>Charisma</strong> score decreases by 1.</li>

                                <li><strong>Venomous Hiss (Recharge 5-6).</strong> As an action, command your snakes to hiss menacingly at one creature you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li>
                                <li><strong>Constricting Coils.</strong> You can use your bonus action to attempt to grapple a creature within 5 feet of you with your hair-snakes. You are proficient with this grapple attempt. You can only have one creature grappled in this way at a time.</li>

The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature begins to stiffen and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 10 minutes or until freed by magic.</li>

                        <li><strong>"Not It!" Reflexes.</strong> As a reaction when you or another little buddy you can see within 30 feet is about to get bonked by an attack, you can briefly rewind their immediate personal timeline. You impose disadvantage on that attack roll. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you get all your uses back after a long rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fast Forward.</strong> You can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to your initiative rolls.</li>

                            <li><strong>Stompy Stomp (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to also stomp your foot with mythic force. All other creatures on the ground within 5 feet of your target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>

                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guardian's Stance.</strong> When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a toy, a shield, or nothing in your hands.</li>
                        <li><strong>Weighing of the Cookies (1/Long Rest).</strong> You have proficiency in the Insight skill. When a creature you can see within 30 feet tells an obvious fib (DM's discretion), you can use your reaction to give them a disappointed puppy-dog stare. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, they feel a pang of guilt and have disadvantage on Charisma (Deception) checks for the next 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bandage Brigade.</strong> You know the <em>mending</em> cantrip. Your repairs on non-magical objects last for 1 hour.</li>

                            <p class="subrace-description">These little cherubs seem to shimmer with an inner light, often humming happily or creating tiny, harmless sparkles just for fun. They adore bright colors, shiny ribbons, and might try to "bless" their friends with a sprinkle of glitter or a hastily picked dandelion. Their extra (purely decorative) arms often get tangled in their clothes or each other.</p>

                            <li><strong>Little Light Show.</strong> You know the <em>prestidigitation</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Many Paws Make Light Play (Cosmetic).</strong> You have an additional pair of smaller, purely cosmetic arms.

                            <li><strong>Aura of Giggles (1/Long Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can radiate a palpable aura of cheerfulness for 1 minute.

                        <p class="subrace-description">These little guardians are fiercely protective of their playmates and their favorite chew toys. They might have a slightly tougher hide that feels like smooth river stones, make rumbling tummy noises when content (or when someone eyes their building blocks), and always seem to know the best spots for digging in the sandbox or splashing in puddles.</p>

                        <li><strong>Kaitiaki's Roar (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> As an action, you can puff out your chest and unleash a surprisingly mighty roar. Each hostile creature within 10 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guardian of the Den.</strong> You are proficient in the Athletics skill. Additionally, when an ally within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to bravely interpose yourself, becoming the target of that attack instead, provided you can see the attacker.</li>
                        <li><strong>Earthly Connection.</strong> You know the <em>mold earth</em> cantrip. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it.</li>

                        <p class="subrace-description">These serene little ones seem to carry an aura of good fortune and gentle mischief, like they've always got a pocketful of lucky charms (or maybe just lint and a half-eaten cracker). They might have a coat that shimmers with hints of rainbow colors when the light hits it just right, tiny velvet nubs on their heads where magnificent antlers will one day sprout, and a tendency to leave trails of glitter (or perhaps just cookie crumbs) wherever they prance.</p>
                        <ul>

                        <li><strong>Auspicious Prance.</strong> Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet. When you use the Dash action, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement on that turn.</li>
                        <li><strong>Serene Blessing (1/Long Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can choose one friendly creature (can be yourself) you can see within 30 feet. The chosen creature gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fortunate Find.</strong> You know the <em>guidance</em> cantrip. Additionally, whenever you make an ability check or saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, you can choose to reroll the die and must use the new roll.

                            <p class="subrace-description">These little ones always seem to have a chill about them, even in summer. They love icy treats, might accidentally freeze their juice box solid, and are surprisingly good at making impressive (if temporary) snow forts, even out of pillows.

                            <li><strong>Icy Puff (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> As an action, you can exhale a puff of frosty air in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier).

                        <li><strong>Quipu Knots (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> You can spend 1 minute tying intricate knots into a piece of string or cord. For the next hour, any creature holding this "quipu" can add a d4 to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.</li>

                        <p>Alright, so these aren't your average, drooling Demi-Gorgons anymore. Well, mostly. Semi-Gorgons are what happens when those mythic sparks start to <em>really</em> crackle. They're the "big kids" of the monstrously-inclined student body, or at least they <em>think</em> they are. They might still have a favorite plushie hidden under their bed and a distinct weakness for juice boxes, but they're starting to get a better handle on their powers. They're probably trying to look cool, act aloof, and maybe even (gasp!) attempt to use the potty like a "grown-up," with varying degrees of success and a lot of dramatic sighing.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Semi-Gorgon Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Semi-Gorgon character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age.</strong> Semi-Gorgons mature at the same rate as humans but carry themselves with an air of someone who's *at least* a year older than they actually are. Lifespan remains impressively long.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> They're starting to understand concepts like "responsibility" and "not eating all the cookies before anyone else gets one," but old habits die hard. Still any alignment, but perhaps with more pronounced leanings.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Semi-Gorgons are <strong>Medium</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.</p>
                        <p><strong>Practiced Poise.</strong> You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks when trying to act more mature, knowledgeable, or in control than you actually feel. You also gain proficiency in one Charisma-based skill of your choice.</p>
                        <p><strong>Monstrous Nature.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and one other language.</p>

                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Serpent Scion</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">These Semi-Gorgons have a bit more control over their serpentine locks, maybe even attempting to style them (with mixed, often spiky, results). They're less "bratty" and more "moody teenager," convinced of their own profound coolness.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by 2, but your <strong>Charisma</strong> score decreases by 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Viperine Locks.</strong> Your snakes are a bit more disciplined.
                                <ul>
                                <li><strong>Chilling Hiss (Recharge Short/Long Rest).</strong> As an action, direct your snakes to unleash a sibilant hiss and a piercing glare at one creature you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute and has disadvantage on attack rolls against you while frightened in this way. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.</li>
                                <li><strong>Grasping Vipers.</strong> Your bonus action grapple with your hair is still effective.</li>
                                <li><strong>Keen-Eyed Serpents.</strong> You retain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight or vibrations.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Stony Gaze (1/Long Rest).</strong> Your petrifying ability is more focused. As an action, target one creature you can see within 30 feet that can also see you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, the creature is restrained. At the end of its next turn, it must repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 1 hour or until freed by magic. You can also choose to end the petrification prematurely as a bonus action.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Time Skipper</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">More aware of their temporal abilities, these Semi-Gorgons might use their powers for "important research" (like finding out what snacks are served next week) or to get a few extra minutes before curfew. They carry an air of someone who knows a secret or two about how things *really* work.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Intelligence</strong> score increases by 2.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shifting Age.</strong> You can still alter your apparent age.</li>
                            <li><strong>Temporal Dodge.</strong> As a reaction when you or another creature you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack, you can impose disadvantage on the roll. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining uses on a long rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Precocious Planning.</strong> Your Intelligence modifier still boosts your initiative.</li>
                            <li><strong>Phase Step (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can briefly shimmer out of sync with time. Until the end of your next turn, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and you can move up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Junior Titan</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">Still incredibly strong, Junior Titans are now trying to channel their might with a bit more finesse (key word: *trying*). They might be the self-appointed "protector" of their group, always ready to flex or show off their "gains" from all that playground activity.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 2.</li>
                            <li><strong>Growing Might.</strong> You still count as one size larger for carrying capacity.</li>
                            <li><strong>Titan's Fortitude.</strong> When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d8. Add your Constitution modifier, and reduce the damage by that total. You can use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quake Slam (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can channel your inner titan to slam the ground. All other creatures on the ground within 10 feet of your target must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.</li>
                            <li><strong>Budding Divinity.</strong> You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Cleric or Paladin spell list. Constitution is your spellcasting ability.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Anubite Acolyte</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">Taking their role as guardians even more seriously, Anubite Acolytes might be found "cataloging" the library's picture books or ensuring the "sacred nap-time silence" is observed. They've probably upgraded their toy ankh to a slightly larger, more official-looking one.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Protector's Vigil.</strong> Your Guardian's Stance remains: when a creature attacks an ally near you, use your reaction to impose disadvantage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Judgment of Conduct (1/Long Rest).</strong> You retain proficiency in Insight. When a creature you can see within 30 feet tells a fib you recognize, you can use your reaction to fix them with a stare of profound disappointment. The creature makes a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed save, they have disadvantage on all Charisma checks for the next hour.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rite of Mending.</strong> You still know the <em>mending</em> cantrip. You can now also use it on a construct or object to grant it 1d4 temporary hit points once per short rest.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Deva Gleam</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">Their inner light shines a bit brighter, and they're more adept at using their charm and minor divine tricks to get what they want (usually more glitter or the best seat). Their extra arms are less clumsy and more expressive, used for dramatic gestures or holding multiple art supplies.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Charisma</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiant Display.</strong> You still know <em>prestidigitation</em>, and your displays are more dazzling. Charisma is your spellcasting ability.</li>
                            <li><strong>Coordinated Grace (Cosmetic).</strong> Your extra pair of smaller arms are more adept. They still can't perform complex combat actions, but you can use them to gain advantage on any Dexterity-based ability check (not saving throws) once per short rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Aura of Joy (1/Long Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can radiate an enhanced aura of joy for 1 minute. Friendly creatures (including yourself) within 15 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed and gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls while your aura is active.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Kaitiaki Guardian</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">More confident and territorial, these Semi-Gorgons see themselves as the true protectors of their "patch" – be it the best corner of the common room or their group of friends. Their hide might be a bit thicker, and their rumbling growls a bit more convincing.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Guardian's Challenge (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> As an action, your roar is more potent. Hostile creatures within 15 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On a failed save, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If a creature fails its save by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the start of your next turn.</li>
                            <li><strong>Steadfast Protector.</strong> You retain proficiency in Athletics. When an ally within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can still use your reaction to become the target. If you do so, you gain resistance to the damage from that one attack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stone Shaper.</strong> You still know the <em>mold earth</em> cantrip (Wisdom spellcasting ability).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                                 <h4><strong>Crinqilin</strong></h4>
                    <hr class="gold-divider">
                    <p class="subrace-description">These Qilin yearlings have fully embraced their connection to the whimsical magic of the Diaper School. Their auspicious nature now manifests in charmingly clumsy ways and unexpected bursts of minor enchantments, often centered around their ever-present, perfectly puffed padding. They exude an air of innocent dependence that belies a surprising resilience and a unique, if somewhat messy, magical talent. Their shimmering coats are often adorned with colorful safety pins or cute magical charms, and their tiny horn-nubs are more for gentle nuzzling than any real defense.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Charisma</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Naturally Padded.</strong> Crinqilins are inherently tied to the comforts and necessities of a well-padded existence. They are always considered to be wearing a diaper, which magically adapts to their needs and form. This state is natural to them and cannot be changed by conventional means. Attempts to remove their padding or potty-train them invariably meet with whimsical magical mishaps, often resulting in the padding reappearing cleaner and fluffier than before. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, as you are comforted by your perpetual padding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cushioned Charm (Diaper-Allure Power).</strong> Your undeniably innocent and comfortably padded appearance can be quite disarming. As an action, you can attempt to charm one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the creature is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as a harmless, endearing being and is unwilling to attack you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Auspicious Accidents &amp; Miracles.</strong> You have an innate connection to playful and protective magic. You know the <em>Spontaneous Accident</em> and <em>Little Miracle</em> cantrips. Additionally, you can cast the <em>Magic Messle</em> spell. You can cast <em>Magic Messle</em> a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blessed Bounce.</strong> Your padded nature makes you surprisingly resilient to falls and tumbles. You have resistance to falling damage, and you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your character level. Additionally, when you are knocked prone, you can use your reaction to immediately stand up without expending any movement.</li>
                    </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Jotun Rimeblood</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">Carrying themselves with a cool (sometimes literally) detachment, Jotun Rimebloods have a better handle on their icy powers. They might seem aloof, but they're fiercely protective of their "territory" – be it their favorite spot in the common room or their circle of friends. They've learned that a little frost can be very persuasive.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by an additional 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>Winter's Resilience.</strong> You have resistance to cold damage.</li>
                            <li><strong>Armor of Hoarfrost (1/Long Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can sheathe yourself in a crackling layer of magical frost. You gain temporary hit points equal to your character level + your Constitution modifier. This icy armor lasts for 10 minutes or until the temporary hit points are depleted.</li>
                            <li><strong>Glacial Slam.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can choose to imbue your strike with biting cold. The target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rime-Forged Might.</strong> You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to break objects or shove creatures.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <h4><strong>Einherjar Aspirant</strong></h4>
                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">More disciplined and focused, Einherjar Aspirants take their "heroic duties" very seriously. They might try to organize their friends into "shield walls" during games and speak with a dramatic flair about honor and glory (usually in relation to who gets the last cookie).</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 1, and your <strong>Charisma</strong> score increases by 2.</li>
                            <li><strong>Warrior's Spirit.</strong> You gain proficiency with martial weapons and shields.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rallying Valor (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> As a bonus action, you can let out an inspiring cry. You and up to three friendly creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that can hear you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chooser of the Brave (1/Long Rest).</strong> When an ally within 30 feet of you drops to 0 hit points but is not killed outright, you can use your reaction to inspire them. That ally can immediately use their reaction to make one weapon attack. If the attack hits, they regain hit points equal to the damage dealt.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fearless Charge.</strong> When you use your action to Dash, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.</li>

                            <hr class="gold-divider">
                            <p class="subrace-description">Their "caring" nature has intensified, often leading them to form very tight-knit, almost cult-like friendships. They offer "wisdom" that sounds profound but is subtly unsettling, and their sweetness has an undeniable edge of the uncanny. They *really* want what's best for you... according to them.</p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Charisma</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                            <li><strong>All-Knowing Empathy.</strong> You gain proficiency in both Insight and Persuasion.</li>
                            <li><strong>Grasping Tendrils.</strong> You can cast <em>mage hand</em> at will (spectral tentacle). Additionally, as a bonus action, you can manifest a larger spectral tentacle from your being for 1 minute. This tentacle has a reach of 10 feet. Once on each of your turns, you can use the tentacle to make a melee spell attack (using Charisma).

                            <p>Gemini Celestians are twin souls born in dual bodies, forever bound by fate. For the first two character levels, you must play exclusively as a Gemini Celestian. At level 3, your progression shifts to your chosen class—but at the cost of two effective class levels, as your twin nature has already claimed its toll.</p>

                        <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> Through your <em>Dualtongue</em> ability, you gain the capacity to speak Common (Dualtongue), enabling seamless integration of verbal spellcasting, singing, or oration with maintained concentration.</li>

                        <h3>Racial Features & Abilities</h3>
                        <div class="race-section">
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Dualtongue:</strong> Beginning at level 1, you may perform vocal actions—such as casting spells, singing, or giving oration—with a unified dual voice. This allows you to maintain the concentration required for a performance while simultaneously activating another verbal spell component.</li>
                            <li><strong>Dualmind:</strong> At level 2, you gain the extraordinary ability to concentrate on two spells that require concentration concurrently. Both spells function independently; maintaining one does not affect the other. Should your concentration break on one, the other remains intact.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shared Form:</strong> Any buff or debuff affecting one twin immediately affects the other. Your twin bond means that magical and nonmagical effects alike are shared.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shared HP Pool:</strong> Your hit points are pooled into one shared resource, divided evenly between your two bodies. Instead of a twin falling unconscious when reduced to 0 HP, your HP is rebalanced (rounding up) between you whenever one twin would drop to 0. If equalizing would leave one twin with only 1 HP or if both halves fall to 0, you are considered unconscious and begin the death count.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Action Economy:</strong> You possess 2 Reactions, and 2 Bonus Actions per round. However, you receive only 1 Movement Action and Spell Action per round, which may be split between your twin bodies as you choose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Natural Dual-Wielding:</strong> When wielding two light and finesse weapons—or when one or both weapons are magically conjured—you may make one additional free (non-proficient) attack once per turn when you take the Attack action.</li>
                            <li><strong>Doubleteaming (Level 2):</strong> Once you reach level 2 with this template, you can roll a skill check, attack roll, or saving throw at advantage a number of times per day equal to your class level (minimum 2 times). This ability can only be used when you and your twin are within visual range of one another.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shared Thoughts:</strong> Your twin is cognitively linked with you. You share thoughts telepathically at all times, regardless of distance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Twin’s Bearing:</strong> You always know the cardinal direction of your twin, even across different planes. Should your twin leave the local plane, you immediately sense their absence.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bonus Proficiency (Level 2):</strong> At level 2 you choose one extra proficiency from among crafts, tools, or games.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arcane Endowment:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                <li><strong>Level 1:</strong> You learn one Wizard cantrip of your choice.</li>
                                <li><strong>Level 2:</strong> You learn one Divine cantrip of your choice.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Class Integration</h3>
                        <p>At level 3, you transition from being a Gemini Celestian to your chosen base class. In effect, your character’s effective class level is your character level minus 2. All standard 5e character creation and advancement rules apply from level 3 onward, while your Gemini Celestian racial features remain permanently.</p>
                        <p><strong>For Casting Classes That Prepare Spells:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Celestians receive 1.5 times the prepared spell pool for their class.</li>
                        <li>Time to prepare spells is reduced by 1/2.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Celestian Vessel</h3>
                        <p>Your creation as a sentient energy being forced into mortal form endows you with uncanny attributes. Though your vessel appears fully grown, your internal essence is in constant flux, mastering both raw power and the limitations of flesh.</p>
                        <div class="race-section">
                            <ul>
                            <li><strong>Spell Empowerment.</strong> When you cast a spell, roll a d4. A result of 1 (25% chance) means your spell is randomly empowered—its damage dice increase by +1. If this empowered spell is a cantrip and you have not taken a bonus action attack or spell that round, you may immediately make one weapon attack or cast a leveled spell.</li>
                            <li><strong>Adaptive Physiology.</strong> Your body adapts on the fly. As a bonus action, choose STR, DEX, or CON to receive a +2 temporary bonus until the end of your next turn. Use this ability a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limited Prophecy.</strong> Your connection to the flow of time allows you brief glimpses into what might be. As a bonus action (usable once per long rest), roll a d20 and store that result. Later, you may replace any d20 roll (attack, damage, saving throw, ability check, etc.) with your stored roll for yourself or any ally.</li>
                            <li><strong>Legendary Comprehension.</strong> Your vast intelligence and battle-hardened insight allow you to strike with uncanny precision. When taking the Attack action, you gain one extra melee weapon attack. This bonus attack stacks with any other extra attacks you might have from class features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Celestial Conduit.</strong> Elemental magic flows through your being. When you cast a spell that deals elemental damage, you may channel that energy to heal yourself. You gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.</li>
                            <li><strong>Augmented Vitality.</strong> Your internal energies can stave off death. When you would drop to 0 HP, you can instead remain at 1 HP and immediately attempt a concentration check (DC = half your maximum HP, rounded up). On success, you stabilize; on failure, you fall unconscious. This can be used once per long rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Foresight of Battle.</strong> Your prophetic instincts extend to the very moment before conflict. At level 4, you gain advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, you may store a second prophecy roll (identical to Limited Prophecy) once per long rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ethereal Shell.</strong> When danger looms, you can momentarily shed your mortal bonds. As a reaction, you may become partly ethereal until the beginning of your next turn. During this time, you gain resistance to all nonmagical damage. This ability can be used once per long rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Enhanced Manifestation.</strong> Your mastery over energy lets you briefly reclaim spent power. Whenever you cast a spell expending a spell slot, you may immediately cast one of your cantrips without consuming any resources. This effect can be used once per short rest.</li>
                            <li><strong>Omniversal Understanding.</strong> Your keen insight into the forces that govern both magic and matter has broadened your skillset. At level 4, choose one tool or musical instrument with which you gain proficiency if you do not already have it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fate’s Intervention.</strong> When the fates seem unkind, you may nudge destiny in your favor. Once per long rest, you can re-roll any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. You must accept the new roll.</li>

                        <p>At racial level 3, the energies that form your being absorb the echoes of countless mortal disciplines. You gain the ability to choose <strong>one</strong> level‑3 subclass feature from any class’s subclass list—be it the Rogue’s <strong>Cunning Action</strong>, the Fighter’s archetype bonus attack, a Cleric Domain’s inaugural feature, or any similar ability normally acquired at 3rd level. This feature functions exactly as it would if you had received it from a class, although it is granted to you as an innate, racial boon and does not count against any subclass features you later obtain with your class levels.</p>
                        <p><strong>Usage Guidelines:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>The selected ability must be one normally available as the initial subclass feature at 3rd level from any class.</li>
                        <li>If the ability’s effects are scaled by class level or proficiency bonus, substitute your Archist racial level in lieu of class level.</li>
                        <li>Should the chosen feature overlap with any later class feature, consult your DM to determine which effect prevails or if they stack.</li>
                        <li>This selection is permanent, symbolizing the deep fusion of energy and the ancient, diverse wisdom of mortal paths.</li>

                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>Pampires are beings touched by the ancient curse of vampirism, yet their existence is uniquely intertwined with an unexpected and persistent reliance on childish comforts. Their appearance combines the classical vampire aesthetic—pale skin, sharp canines, and an otherworldly grace—with a perpetual youthfulness that belies their true nature. Pampires have a wide range of skin tones, though all share an unmistakable pallor particular to their kind.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Cultural Description</h3>
                        <p>Pampires possess an inherent, often formidable strength and resilience, but this power is tethered to their need to consume blood or a suitable blood allegory. Many Pampires, particularly those associated with institutions like the Diaper School, have access to specially prepared blood allegories "on tap." Some even cultivate a refined palate for raw meats, such as steak tartare, as a substitute. A defining characteristic of Pampires is their physiological and magical incontinence, which necessitates the constant use of diapers. This often creates a stark contrast between their formidable vampiric capabilities and their seemingly juvenile dependency.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Pampire Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Pampire character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Strength</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age.</strong> Pampires reach physical maturity at a rate similar to humans but can live for several centuries, often maintaining a youthful appearance as long as they are regularly fed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Pampires can be of any alignment. Their inherent needs might push them towards pragmatic or selfish choices, but individuals vary greatly. Those raised in structured environments like the Diaper School might adopt the alignments prevalent there.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Pampires are typically <strong>Medium</strong>, though some can be <strong>Small</strong>. You choose the size when you select this race.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to the night, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Padded Existence.</strong> Your vampiric nature has been uniquely altered. Pampires are physiologically and magically incontinent, requiring the use of diapers. You cannot be potty-trained by normal or magical means. Due to this, you qualify to take the Diaper Mastery feat at character creation (if available in your campaign) as you are considered Incontinent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Blood Thirst.</strong> You must consume at least one ration of fresh blood or a suitable blood allegory (such as those provided by the Diaper School, or equivalent amounts of very rare raw meat like steak tartare) every 24 hours to avoid suffering ill effects. If you go 24 hours without feeding, you gain one level of the Unfed condition. Successfully feeding removes all current levels of the Unfed condition and any associated penalties.</p>
                        <p><strong>Unliving Fortitude (When Fed).</strong> As long as you are not suffering from any levels of the Unfed condition, you do not need to sleep and are unaffected by magical sleep. Instead of sleeping, you can spend 4 hours in a state of inactive, conscious reverie to gain the benefits of a long rest. While in this state, you remain aware of your surroundings. Additionally, while fed, you do not need to breathe.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bat Form.</strong> Once per long rest, you can use your action to polymorph into a Tiny bat. This transformation lasts for 1 hour, or until you use a bonus action to revert to your true form, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. While in bat form, your game statistics, including your mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a standard bat, though you retain your alignment, personality, Hit Points, and current hit point total. You also retain your Padded Existence trait (your padding magically resizes with you for safety and comfort). You gain a flying speed of 30 feet. You cannot speak in bat form.</p>
                        <p>While in bat form, you can use your action to make a special bite attack. This attack uses your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) for the attack roll and deals 1 piercing damage. If the target is a willing creature, or a creature that is grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, you can feed from it as part of this attack. Feeding in this manner counts towards sating your Blood Thirst for the day. If you are reduced to 0 hit points in bat form, you revert to your true form, and any excess damage carries over.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and one other language of your choice (often Undercommon or a language fitting your background).</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h4><strong>Unfed Condition</strong></h4>
                        <p>If you fail to meet your Blood Thirst requirement, you gain levels of the Unfed condition. These levels are cumulative. All levels of Unfed and their effects are removed once you consume one ration of blood or blood allegory.</p>

                        <li><strong>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</strong> You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. If you start your turn in direct sunlight, you take 1d4 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Radiant Vulnerability.</strong> You have vulnerability to radiant damage.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sunlight Mitigation.</strong> The damage from Sunlight Hypersensitivity can be prevented by taking extensive precautions. This might include wearing thick, completely obscuring clothing, using a specially treated, expensive parasol (costing at least 50 gp), or regular application of a potent, magically infused sunscreen (costing 10 gp per application, lasting 1 hour, often referred to as SPF 200). However, your Radiant Vulnerability cannot be negated by such mundane or low-level magical means.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nocturne Magic.</strong> You know two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. Additionally, you can cast one 1st-level spell of your choice from the wizard spell list once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Neither the cantrips nor the 1st-level spell can produce effects that create sunlight (like the Daylight spell) or primarily deal radiant damage. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</li>
                        <li><strong>Satiated Power.</strong> If you consume a ration of blood or blood allegory when you are not suffering from any levels of the Unfed condition, you can choose to become Satiated. For the next hour, you gain a +2 bonus to your attack and damage rolls. You can only benefit from being Satiated once per long rest.</li>

                        <li><strong>Master of Forms.</strong> Your Bat Form trait improves. You can use it a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest. Additionally, when you use your Bat Form, you can choose to transform into any Small or Medium humanoid creature you have seen before, instead of a bat. Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen humanoid, but you retain your alignment, personality, Hit Points, and current hit point total. You also retain your Padded Existence trait (your padding magically resizes). You do not gain any class features or special abilities of the form you take. Your equipment does not merge into your new form; it either falls to the ground in your space, is worn by it if the new form can wear it, or is carried by it if the new form can carry it. While in humanoid form, you can feed via a bite if the target is willing, grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, similar to your bat form's feeding. This transformation also lasts for 1 hour or until you use a bonus action to revert, drop to 0 HP, or die.</li>

                        <p>Living Dolls are constructs given the spark of life, their forms often mimicking humanoid figures but crafted from materials such as porcelain, wood, cloth, or even stitched-together parts. Their appearance can range from eerily beautiful to charmingly rustic or unsettlingly uncanny. Their size varies greatly depending on their design and purpose. Movement might be graceful and fluid or slightly stiff and jointed.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Description</h3>
                        <p>Living Dolls are beings searching for their place in a world not entirely made for them. Their "culture" is often a patchwork of the values and beliefs of their creators or the communities they find themselves in. Many grapple with questions of identity, free will, and the nature of their own existence. They can be fiercely loyal, driven by a programmed purpose, or passionately seeking to define themselves beyond their origins. Social interaction can be a learning process, with some dolls being remarkably empathetic and others struggling to understand nuanced emotions.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>Crinklehearts are fiendish beings who, despite their infernal lineage, often present with an air of disarming youthfulness and an almost cherubic cuteness, especially in settings like the Diaper School. They typically possess classic fiendish traits such as small, often decorative horns that might be adorned with ribbons or bells, a lithe tail that sways with playful curiosity (or mischievous intent), and perhaps small, vestigial wings that are more plush and cute than functional for flight. Their skin tones can vary wildly, from soft pastels to deeper, more traditional fiendish hues, but their eyes always hold a captivating, knowing sparkle. They delight in comfortable, often crinkly, padding, seeing it as both a fashion statement and a tool of their unique charm.</p>

                        <h3>Cultural Description</h3>
                        <p>Crinkleheart "culture," especially within unique environments like the Diaper School, revolves around the art of subtle influence and the joy of playful manipulation. They are masters of using their inherent cuteness and the endearing sounds of their padded attire to get what they want, whether it's an extra cookie, a favored toy, or the unwavering attention of a potential "friend." While their succubus/incubus nature might suggest darker inclinations, many Crinklehearts find more amusement in harmless pranks, charming their way out of trouble, and creating an atmosphere of adorable chaos. They are social creatures who thrive on interaction, often forming surprisingly strong bonds, though one should always be wary of the charming web they weave.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Crinkleheart Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Crinkleheart character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Charisma</strong> score increases by 2, and your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by 1.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age.</strong> Crinklehearts reach physical maturity at a similar rate to humans but can live for centuries, often maintaining a deceptively youthful and cute appearance indefinitely if they so choose.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Often chaotic, rarely truly evil. Their charm can be manipulative, but usually for playful or self-serving ends rather than outright malice. Many delight in mischief and causing adorable disarray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Crinklehearts are typically <strong>Small or Medium</strong>, but are generally slender and lithe, adding to their disarming cuteness.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to twilit realms and shadowy dealings, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fiendish Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to <strong>fire damage</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Crinkly Tradition.</strong> Your ancestral lineage within the Diaper School demesne has indelibly altered your once-fearsome infernal bloodlines- Crinklehearts, obviously, need to wear diapers- as their bodies have adapted to physiologically and magically resist any attempts to pottytrain. Because of this, all Crinklehearts qualify to take the Diaper Mastery feature at character creation as they are considered ***Incontinent*** as per the flaw.</p>
                        <p><strong>Crinkle Charm (1/Long Rest).</strong> As an action, you can target one humanoid you can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be charmed by you for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the target regards you as an incredibly cute and harmless being and is strongly inclined to indulge your requests, look after your well-being, and protect you from harm, provided these actions are not obviously self-destructive to itself. If you or your companions do anything harmful to the charmed creature, or if it is forced into a situation it perceives as directly endangering you against its protective instincts, the effect ends.</p>
                        <p><strong>Disarming Cuteness.</strong> You can use your adorable appearance and the endearing sounds of your padded attire to your advantage. You gain proficiency in the <strong>Persuasion</strong> skill. Additionally, when a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll, as your overwhelming cuteness makes them hesitate or second-guess their aggression. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
                        <p><strong>Soft Landing.</strong> Your ever-present padding offers a surprising amount of protection from falls. When you fall, you can use your reaction to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your character level.</p>
                        <p><strong>Vestigial Wings.</strong> You have small, often plush, leathery, or feathery wings. They are not strong enough for true flight but might allow you to flutter briefly or slow your descent slightly. With DM permission, they might grant advantage on checks to prevent being knocked prone or allow you to ignore the first 10 feet of a fall when calculating falling damage (stacking with Soft Landing for greater effect).</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and <strong>Abyssal</strong> or <strong>Infernal</strong> (your choice).</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <p><strong>Heart's Desire.</strong> Crinklehearts require regular fulfillment of their Source of Joy to maintain their natural charm and vitality. At character creation, choose one of the following Sources of Joy:</p>

                        <p class="subrace-description">These Crinklehearts lean into the more mischievous side of their fiendish heritage, delighting in playful pranks and using their charm to sow delightful confusion. Their cuteness is a weapon of delightful chaos.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Intelligence</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Master of Mischief.</strong> You gain proficiency in the <strong>Deception</strong> or <strong>Sleight of Hand</strong> skill (your choice).</li>
                        <li><strong>Playful Hex.</strong> You know the <em>minor illusion</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the <em>hideous laughter</em> spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oopsie Daisy.</strong> When a creature you can see within 30 feet fails a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to maintain balance or a Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling prone, you can use your reaction to make their tumble slightly more spectacular and distracting. That creature has disadvantage on its next Wisdom (Perception) check made before the end of its next turn.</li>

                        <p class="subrace-description">Cherished Hearts exude an almost irresistible aura of sweetness and vulnerability. Their charm inspires fierce loyalty and a powerful desire in others to protect and pamper them. They are experts at tugging heartstrings and making even the toughest individuals melt.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Aura of Adorableness.</strong> You learn the <em>friends</em> cantrip. When the spell ends, the target doesn't automatically become hostile to you; instead, they must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or feel a lingering fondness for you for 1 minute, though they are no longer charmed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Protective Pout (1/Short or Long Rest).</strong> When an ally you can see within 30 feet is hit by an attack, you can use your reaction to let out a heart-wrenching whimper or pout. The attacker must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the attacker feels a pang of guilt and the damage dealt by the attack is halved.</li>
                        <li><strong>Comforting Presence.</strong> When you use the Help action to aid an ally in an ability check, the creature you help gains temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1), which last for 1 minute.</li>

                        <p class="subrace-description">Feral Hearts embrace a more primal, instinctual aspect of their fiendish nature, yet they retain an undeniable, almost wild-child cuteness. They are more attuned to the raw, untamed energies of their lineage, often appearing a bit scruffier, with perhaps more pronounced (though still adorable) fiendish features like slightly longer claws or a more expressive, twitchy tail. Their charm is less about refined manipulation and more about an irresistible, untamed allure mixed with a hint of playful danger.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Wisdom</strong> score increases by 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>Primal Instincts.</strong> You gain proficiency in the <strong>Survival</strong> skill. Your connection to your more 'native' fiendish senses gives you an edge when tracking, foraging, or navigating harsh or unfamiliar environments.</li>
                        <li><strong>Wildheart Allure.</strong> You know the <em>animal friendship</em> cantrip. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it. You can only target <strong>Small or Tiny</strong> beasts with this version of the spell, and the friendship manifested is often more of a boisterous, playful bond.<br>
                        When you reach <strong>3rd level</strong>, you can cast the <em>entangle</em> spell once using this trait, envisioning the restraints as grasping, playful shadowy vines or fiendishly cute, thorny brambles. You regain the ability to cast <em>entangle</em> this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this spell.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sudden Pounce.</strong> If you move <strong>at least 15 feet straight toward a creature</strong> and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can use your <strong>bonus action</strong> to attempt a <strong>playful, surprising shove</strong>. The target must succeed on a <strong>Strength saving throw</strong> (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, your choice) or be pushed <strong>5 feet away</strong> from you. This shove does not knock the target prone.</li>

                        <p><strong>Age.</strong> Bovibuddies mature at a similar rate to humans, though their robust nature means they often enjoy vitality well into their later years (up to 120).</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Most Cowbuddies are community-focused and kindhearted. However, some—especially those following the Bull Buddy path—lean toward a fiercely independent or even chaotic alignment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> You can be <strong>Small</strong> or <strong>Medium</strong>. Dairy Friends tend to be medium in stature, while Bull Buddies may be either, with a compact build that belies their formidable strength.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet, a bit faster than most.</p>
                        <p><strong>Natural Hooved Feet.</strong> Your hoof-like nails let you make unarmed strikes that deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage using your Strength modifier. Despite this armored foot, you still have the gait and step of a humanoid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Rapid Digestion.</strong> Due to their numerous bellies and oversized liver, Cowbuddies have resistance to all ingested poisons, and all non-magical poisons. They have immunity to all common-rarity poisons. However, the speed of their metabolism and caloric needs mean that a Cowbuddy must roll potty-checks twice as often as other characters, and rolls a CON-based potty-check after any strenuous action.</p>
                        <p><strong>Naturally Unpottytrained.</strong> Out in the fields there wasn't ever much need to do more than void whenever one needed- and Cowbuddies haven't really grown up past that time-honored tradition. Due to their nature, Cowbuddies are <strong>Incontinent</strong> as per the Flaw, <em>and as such immediately qualify for the Diaper Mastery feat at creation.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>Horned Charge.</strong> Once per short rest, when you move 15 feet in a straight line toward a creature, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with your horns. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage plus your Strength modifier. If the target is knocked prone, you may move an additional 5 feet as part of the bonus action.</p>
                        <p><strong>Bovine Fortitude.</strong> You have proficiency in Constitution saving throws.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one additional language of your choice.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Description</h3>
                        <p>Children of the deep, Carcharadonians are formidable shark-folk with powerful builds standing between 5 and 7 feet tall. Their skin ranges from slate gray to deep blue, sometimes bearing the distinctive markings of their shark heritage. Rows of sharp teeth fill their elongated jaws, and their eyes—often black or darkly colored—possess a predatory focus that can be unnerving to land-dwellers. Their powerful forms move with surprising grace both on land and in water, though they clearly appear most at home beneath the waves.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Cultural Description</h3>
                        <p>Perfectly adapted to life beneath the waves, Carcharodonians are the apex predators of their aquatic domains. Yet, the call of the surface world, and perhaps the peculiar necessities of places like the Diaper School, sometimes draw these mighty beings into unfamiliar territory. Their societies vary based on subrace—from the solitary, powerful Benthic Folk to the social, cunning Shoal Folk and the nomadic Waves Folk. While their primal instincts and predatory nature are undeniable, many have developed sophisticated cultures and traditions. The very pressure that makes them mighty in the ocean depths presents unique challenges on land, particularly regarding bodily functions, leading many to adopt the padding practices common at institutions like the Diaper School.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Carcharodonian Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Carcharodonian character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by 2. In addition, either your <strong>Strength</strong> or your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by 3 (your choice).</p>
                        <p><strong>Age.</strong> Carcharodonians mature quickly, reaching adulthood around age 15. They can live up to 120 years.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Carcharodonians possess a predatory nature and a strong sense of self-preservation, often leading them towards neutral or chaotic alignments. However, societal influences and individual choices can lead them to any alignment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Carcharodonians are typically powerfully built and stand between 5 and 7 feet tall. Your size is <strong>Medium</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed.</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30 feet</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Swim Speed.</strong> You have a swim speed equal to your walking speed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> Accustomed to the gloomy depths, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within <strong>60 feet</strong> of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Amphibious.</strong> You can breathe air and water.</p>
                        <p><strong>Underwater Agility.</strong> When you are underwater, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aquatic Aggression.</strong> If you move at least 10 feet through water in a straight line towards a creature and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, that attack deals an extra 1d6 damage of the weapon's type.</p>
                        <p><strong>Land-Incontinence.</strong> The immense pressure of the deep waters is integral to a Carcharodonian's bodily regulation. When they spend extended periods above water, this natural support is lost, leading to a physiological need for absorbent padding, much like many residents of Diaper School. While submerged, Carcharodonians who possessed bladder control retain it, though they might opt for a swim diaper for convenience if they anticipate returning to the surface soon. This trait means you are considered <strong>Incontinent</strong> for the purposes of qualifying for feats like Diaper Mastery, if available in your campaign.</p>
                        <p><strong>Sharkfolk Weapon Training.</strong> You have proficiency with spears, nets, and tridents.</p>
                        <p><strong>Armored Swimmer.</strong> Your natural affinity for water allows you to move more easily in armor than most. You do not suffer disadvantage on Strength (Athletics) checks made to swim when wearing any armor other than full plate. Additionally, wearing armor you are proficient with does not reduce your swim speed unless it is full plate.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write <strong>Common</strong> and <strong>Aquan</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Among the most ancient and steadfast residents of the Scholia Diaspros, the Waddlehooves are a robust and spirited centaurine race. It is said their ancestors trod the nascent lands of this very plane alongside Professor Horace Hootz himself, playing a pivotal role in the early exploration and shaping of the world under The Headmaster's guidance. Possessing a boundless energy and an insatiable curiosity akin to that of young ponies, Waddlehooves retain their zest for roaming and ranging throughout their lives, regardless of their specific clangroup or age. Hearty, capable, and naturally attuned to the rhythms of both the wild and the peculiar necessities of Diaper School, they are a common and cherished sight, their cheerful waddles and thundering gallops a familiar sound in the halls and fields.</p>
                        
                        <p>Unlike many traditional centaur tales that speak of prideful reluctance to bear riders, Waddlehooves often exhibit a joyful willingness to share their strength and speed. They relish the opportunity to give playful horsey-rides to their smaller friends, readily offer their backs to aid tired or injured comrades, and, depending on their clangroup and individual prowess, some may even rise to become legendary mounts for truly capable and respected warriors. This cooperative spirit is a hallmark of their open and generous nature.</p>
                        <hr class="gold-divider">
                        <h3>Waddlehooves Traits</h3>
                        <p>Your Waddlehooves character has the following racial traits:</p>
                        <p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a Monstrosity (Centaur).</p>
                        <p><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your Strength score increases by 4, and your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
                        <p><strong>Age:</strong> Waddlehooves mature at a rate similar to humans but are considered adults around 16. They live robust lives, often reaching 300 to 320 years. Their playful spirit, however, remains ageless.</p>
                        <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> With their roaming nature and inherent curiosity, Waddlehooves lean towards chaotic or neutral alignments. Their strong community bonds and loyalty can also lead them towards good.</p>
                        <p><strong>Size:</strong> Waddlehooves stand between 6 and 8 feet tall from hoof to head, with their equine bodies being proportionally large. Your size is Large.</p>
                        <p><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is 60 feet. You may choose to slow down and trot at the speed of your adventurers without exerting yourself.</p>
                        <p><strong>Swift Strider:</strong> You can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>
                        <p><strong>Powerful Charge:</strong> Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use for unarmed strikes. When you hit with a hoof attack, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier. Additionally, if you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can use your bonus action to make one hoof attack against the same target.</p>
                        <p><strong>Waddlehoof Kick:</strong> As an action, you can deliver a powerful kick with your hooves. Make a melee attack roll using Strength against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, and you can choose to push the target up to 10 feet away from you.</p>
                        <p><strong>Equine Build:</strong> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.</p>
                        <p><strong>Natural Incontinence:</strong> Like many of the Scholia Diaspros's denizens, and true to their equine nature, Waddlehooves are naturally incontinent. Their bodies are simply not designed for prolonged control outside of their most primal needs. They are, however, remarkably adaptable and easily accustomed to the use of diapers, often seeing them as a practical part of life. This trait means you are considered Incontinent for the purposes of qualifying for feats like Diaper Mastery, if available in your campaign.</p>
                        <p><strong>Languages:</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. You also understand the specific Centaur dialect of Sylvan, which incorporates more whinnies, snorts, and hoof-stamping emphasis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hoof-Bound Weapon Training:</strong> You have proficiency with lances, shortbows, longbows, and armor crafted primarily from wood, vines, and other plant materials (such as Oaken Scale Mail or Vine Weave Armor, if available).</p>
                        <p><strong>Unbridled Gait:</strong> Your four-legged form is built for efficient, sustained movement across vast distances. You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion caused by a forced march. Additionally, when traveling for an hour or more, your speed increases, allowing you to cover more ground. If you are carrying no more than a medium load, your overland travel pace is increased as shown in the Waddlehoof Overland Travel table.</p>
                        <p>This additional speed and pace assumes you are not stopping for combat or long breaks.</p>

                            <li><strong>Sylvan Knowledge:</strong> You gain proficiency in the Nature skill. You also choose one from the following: proficiency in the Survival skill or proficiency with an herbalism kit.

            <p><i>"Once thought to be mere legends from the plane's primordial past, the Scampersaurians have been reawakened. Whether through a time-warping accident or hatched from ancient eggs discovered deep beneath the Academy, these dinosaur-like beings are the newest (and oldest) toddlers on campus. They possess a primal power, a wild spirit, and a general confusion about modern concepts like 'inside voices' and 'potty-training,' making them a perfect fit for the chaotic halls of Diaper School."</i></p>

            <h3>Scampersaurian Traits</h3>
            <p>Your Scampersaurian character has the following racial traits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a <strong>Monstrosity</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your <strong>Constitution</strong> score increases by <strong>2</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Scampersaurians mature quickly, reaching young adulthood by age 10, but can live for several hundred years.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Their primal instincts and simple desires lean them towards neutral or chaotic alignments.</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> You are <strong>Medium</strong>. Specific subraces will alter this.</li>
                <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>30</strong> feet.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Armor:</strong> Your hide is thick and scaly, granting you a base Armor Class of <strong>13 + your Dexterity modifier</strong>. You can use this natural armor calculation instead of any armor you wear. A shield's benefits apply as normal.</li>
                <li><strong>Primal Savagery:</strong> Your fangs and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing or slashing damage (your choice) equal to <strong>1d6 + your Strength modifier</strong>, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</li>
                <li><strong>Primal Incontinence:</strong> Having been thrust into the modern era from a time before toilets were even a concept, your Scampersaurian has no instinct for potty training. You are considered <strong>Incontinent</strong> for the purpose of qualifying for the Diaper Mastery feat at character creation.</li>

            <p class="subrace-description">Big, loud, and perpetually hungry, the Tyrannobabu Wrecks are the playground tyrants of the Scampersaurians. Their tiny arms are deceptively strong, but their real power is in their mighty jaws and earth-shaking tantrums.</p>

Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="subrace-description">Light, agile, and masters of the sky, the Pterodac-Tots are the scouts and daredevils of the Scampersaurians. They love soaring through the Academy's high halls and open fields, often with a screech of delight that can be heard from a mile away.</p>

                <li><strong>Flight:</strong> You have a flying speed of <strong>30</strong> feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.</li>
                <li><strong>Screeching Dive:</strong> If you fly at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra <strong>1d6</strong> damage of the weapon's type.</li>
                <li><strong>Hollow Bones:</strong> You are built for flight, not for brawling. You have vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.</li>

            <hr class="gold-divider">
            
            <h4><strong>Veloci-Rascals (Raptor Type)</strong></h4>
            <hr class="gold-divider">
            <p class="subrace-description">Fast, intelligent, and working with terrifying pack coordination, the Veloci-Rascals are the strategists and tricksters of the Scampersaurians. They communicate with a series of clicks and whistles, setting up elaborate pranks and tactical ambushes with equal glee.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ability Score Increase:</strong> Your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score increases by <strong>2</strong>, and your <strong>Intelligence</strong> score increases by <strong>1</strong>.</li>

            </ul>
            <hr class="gold-divider">
            
            <h4><strong>Armored Titans (Thyreophora/Ceratopsian Type)</strong></h4>
            <hr class="gold-divider">
            <p class="subrace-description">These Scamps are the living fortresses of the playground, combining the stubborn defense of an Ankylosaur with the charging might of a Triceratops.

On a hit, the target takes <strong>2d6 + your Strength modifier</strong> bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be stunned until the start of your next turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Light Charge:</strong> When you move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and then hit it with a melee attack on the same turn, you can use your bonus action to shove the creature.

            </ul>

                        <p><i>"They wove the first banners of the Old War and the first diapers of the peace that followed. Their threads are woven into the very history of this Academy. Show them respect, for they are both cradle and warrior."</i><br>- Professor Ardelie Heller</p>
                        
                        <h3>The Ancient Weavers</h3>
                        <p>Among the oldest denizens of the Scholia Diaspros, the Diaparachnids are a race of sophisticated arachnoids whose history is inseparable from that of the Academy itself. In the ages before the Old War, it was the Diaparachnids who first perfected the art of weaving magical silks. Their many hands worked the looms that produced the first enchanted student uniforms, the resilient armor worn by the Academy's defenders, and, as the needs of the realm evolved, the very first diapers designed to withstand the rigors of magical mishaps and extended nursery stays.</p>
                        <p>While their often-imposing appearance can be unnerving to other races, Diaparachnids are a deeply intellectual and industrious people, with a society built on intricate craftsmanship, communal living, and ancient traditions. They move with an unsettling grace, their multiple eyes missing no detail, their many arms capable of performing feats of complex artistry and martial prowess simultaneously. Though they come in many shapes—from the almost-humanoid to the centaur-like—all Diaparachnids share a common heritage as the master artisans and silent guardians of the deep places, their webs and halls forming a secret geography within and below the Academy.</p>

                            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Diaparachnids mature at the same rate as humans but can live for <strong>several centuries</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Diaparachnids' societies are built on order and tradition, leading them towards <strong>lawful</strong> alignments. However, their individual pursuits can lead them anywhere on the spectrum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Size:</strong> Your size is determined by your subrace.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is <strong>35 feet.</strong> You have a climb speed of <strong>35 feet</strong> on walls and vertical surfaces that are not slippery or magically slick.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arachnovision:</strong> You have a superior, multi-faceted perception of the world. You have <strong>Blindsight</strong> to a range of <strong>30 feet</strong>, <strong>Darkvision</strong> to a range of <strong>120 feet</strong>, and <strong>lowlight vision</strong> to <strong>300ft</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Spiderwalking:</strong> All Diaparachnids can climb up vertical surfaces, but only those with a robust spider morphology or small size can walk upon the ceilings of rooms and surfaces. Slick or slippery surfaces pose the same challenge to walk upon, but result in falling and possible damage if a spiderling loses their footing on these surfaces. A spiderling does not suffer these disadvantages inside the vicinity of their webbing, no matter their size.</li>
                            <li><strong>Many-Armed:</strong> You have <strong>six arms</strong>. You can use your extra arms to interact with objects, provide the Help action to up to <strong>three persons</strong> within five feet of them at one time, or perform other tasks, but you cannot use them to wield additional weapons or shields in combat. You can prepare spells or perform manual crafting tasks in <strong>half the time</strong>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Webspinning:</strong> All Diaparachnids can perform some manner of web-spinning, creating various useful structures. With <strong>1 hour</strong> of work and adequate nutrition, you can create any of the following:</li>

At creation Diaparachnids are considered <strong>Incontinent</strong> as per the trait for the purpose of qualifying for taking the diaper-mastery feat if offered. Diaparachnids must ensure they have diapers suited for their morphology- be that a prominent spinneret or a full spider-like lower-half.</li>
