### Ghost Traits and Subrace Mechanics
A Ghost character starts with the Ghost's unique racial traits and supplements them with traits from their original "living" race, reflecting the remnants of their mortal life. This combination creates a spectral version of their original race with added abilities tied to their incorporeal nature.

**Racial Features:**

- **Ability Score Increase.** Your **Wisdom** score increases by 1, and your **Intelligence** score increases by 1.
  
- **Size.** Ghosts retain the size of their original race (e.g., Small or Medium).

- **Speed.** Your base walking speed is **30 feet**, unless your original race grants a higher walking speed.

- **Sleepless Spectre.** You do not need to sleep. Instead, you enter a semi-dormant state for 4 hours, akin to elven meditation. During this time, you are fully aware of your surroundings. You are also immune to charm effects that rely on sleep.

- **Darkvision.** You can see in darkness within **60 feet** as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Formless Passage.** Twice per long rest, you can assume an incorporeal form for up to **10 minutes**. While incorporeal, you can move through non-magical objects, doors, or walls as if they were difficult terrain. You cannot end your turn inside a solid object. This ability does not work on magically locked or sealed areas.

- **Spectral Manipulation.** You can cast the **mage hand** cantrip a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once). Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this cantrip.

- **Wail of the Lost.** As an action, you can release an otherworldly wail. Each creature within **10 feet** that can hear you must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be **frightened** of you for 1 minute. Creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. You can use this ability once per long rest.

- **Ethereal Insight.** Gain proficiency in **Arcana** and **Religion**.

- **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write **Common** and one additional language of your choice.

---
 ### Ghost Subraces
 
 **Ghost subraces** are unique in that they combine the traits of your original "living" race with the spectral abilities of the Ghost race. Rather than replacing features, you layer the essence of your mortal past onto the Ghost template.  
  
 #### To create a Ghost subrace:    
 - **Start with the Ghost race as your base.** Use its ability score increases, racial traits, and abilities as your foundation.    
 - **Add traits from your original race:**  
  - **Retain** the **size, appearance, and cultural traits** (e.g., skill or tool proficiencies) of your original race.  
  
\page
   - Keep any unique non-physical abilities from your original race, such as resistance to magical effects or innate spellcasting.  
>  
> - **Replace features tied to a physical body:** Remove features of your original race that are tied to a corporeal form, such as climbing speed, natural weapons, or traits related to physical endurance.  
>  
> By blending the Ghost race with your living race, you create a character that carries forward the identity and culture of their past life while embracing the new powers and challenges of their spectral existence.

## Morphian Changeling
The Morphian Changeling is an advanced offshoot of the typical changeling, possessing an unparalleled ability to adapt their form to mirror the physiology of other races. They maintain the flexibility and charisma of their changeling heritage, while boasting transformative powers far beyond what most changelings can achieve.

### Morphian Traits
As a Morphian Changeling, you have the following racial traits.  

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.  

**Age.** Morphians mature at the same rate as changelings and live to be around 120 years old.  

**Alignment.** Morphians, like changelings, tend toward chaotic alignments due to their adaptable nature.  

**Size.** Morphians are Medium, though they may transform into Small creatures when mimicking other races.  

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.  

**Robust Transformation.** As a Morphian, you can transform into any Medium or Small-sized race you have previously touched with bare skin. This transformation requires a 12-hour biological process that functions as a trance-like sleep, during which you alter your racial phylogeny. Once this process is complete, you gain all of the racial traits, abilities, and proficiencies of the chosen race as if applying a subrace to your character. Note that the base Morphian traits are considered the "subrace" for this purpose.  

**Form Limitations.** While temporarily disguising yourself using your standard changeling transformation ability, you can only mimic races you have touched but do not gain the racial abilities or powers of any race other than your current chosen form. This makes your disguise purely aesthetic in nature unless it matches your active "subrace."  

**Temporary Transformation.** As an action, you can temporarily transform to take on the physical appearance of a race you have touched. This transformation lasts up to 1 hour or until you revert to your original form (no action required). You cannot gain the racial traits, powers, or abilities of a race different from your current chosen form.  

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common, two other languages of your choice, and any racial language you acquire through a chosen form.  

**Subrace Selection.** Your subrace is determined by the race you last transformed into using your **Robust Transformation** ability. You must complete the 12-hour transformation process to change subraces.
:::
### Transformation Mechanics
To use **Robust Transformation**, you must have physically touched a member of a race with bare skin at least once before attempting to emulate that race. You may only have one active chosen form at a time. When in your chosen form, you are treated as a member of that race for all effects that apply based on race (e.g., racial abilities, magical affinities).  

If you wish to transform into a new race, you must complete the 12-hour process to adjust your racial phylogeny. This involves a trance-like state during which your Morphian biology adapts to mimic the race in question.
