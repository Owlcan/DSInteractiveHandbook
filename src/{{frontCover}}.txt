# Scampersaurians

{{quote
Once thought to be mere legends from the plane's primordial past, the Scampersaurians have been reawakened. Whether through a time-warping accident or hatched from ancient eggs discovered deep beneath the Academy, these dinosaur-like beings are the newest (and oldest) toddlers on campus. They possess a primal power, a wild spirit, and a general confusion about modern concepts like 'inside voices' and 'potty-training,' making them a perfect fit for the chaotic halls of Diaper School.

## Scampersaurian Traits
Your Scampersaurian character has the following racial traits:

**Creature Type:** You are a **Monstrosity**.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by **2**.

**Age:** Scampersaurians mature quickly, reaching young adulthood by age 10, but can live for several hundred years.

**Alignment:** Their primal instincts and simple desires lean them towards neutral or chaotic alignments.

**Size:** You are Medium. Specific subraces will alter this.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is **30** feet.

**Natural Armor:** Your hide is thick and scaly, granting you a base Armor Class of **13 + your Dexterity modifier**. You can use this natural armor calculation instead of any armor you wear. A shieldâ€™s benefits apply as normal.

**Primal Savagery:** Your fangs and claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal piercing or slashing damage (your choice) equal to **1d6 + your Strength modifier**, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

**Primal Incontinence:** Having been thrust into the modern era from a time before toilets were even a concept, your Scampersaurian has no instinct for potty training. You are considered **Incontinent** for the purpose of qualifying for the Diaper Mastery feat at character creation.

## Scampersaurian Subraces
You must choose one of the following five subraces.

### Tyrannobabu Wrecks (Theropod Type)
Big, loud, and perpetually hungry, the Tyrannobabu Wrecks are the playground tyrants of the Scampersaurians. Their tiny arms are deceptively strong, but their real power is in their mighty jaws and earth-shaking tantrums.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by **2**.

**Size:** Your size is **Large**.

**Powerful Bite:** Your bite is a formidable weapon. The damage for your Primal Savagery bite attack increases to **1d10**.

**Fearsome Roar:** As an action, you can unleash a terrifying roar. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or become frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Bronto-Bottoms (Brachiosaur Type)
Gentle giants with hearts as big as their bodies, the Bronto-Bottoms are the calm, steady members of the Scampersaurians. Their immense size and long necks give them a unique perspective on the world, though they are prone to accidentally knocking things over with their weighty rears.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by **2**, and your Constitution score increases by an additional **1**.

**Size:** Your size is **Large**.

**Long Neck:** You have a reach of **10** feet for your melee attacks.

**Stomp:** As a bonus action, you can make a special melee attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to **1d4 + your Strength modifier** and must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.

**Massive Build:** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.

### Pterodac-Tots (Pterosaur Type)
Light, agile, and masters of the sky, the Pterodac-Tots are the scouts and daredevils of the Scampersaurians. They love soaring through the Academy's high halls and open fields, often with a screech of delight that can be heard from a mile away.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by **2**.

**Flight:** You have a flying speed of **30** feet. To use this speed, you can't be wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Screeching Dive:** If you fly at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra **1d6** damage of the weapon's type.

**Hollow Bones:** You are built for flight, not for brawling. You have vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

### Veloci-Rascals (Raptor Type)
Fast, intelligent, and working with terrifying pack coordination, the Veloci-Rascals are the strategists and tricksters of the Scampersaurians. They communicate with a series of clicks and whistles, setting up elaborate pranks and tactical ambushes with equal glee.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Dexterity score increases by **2**, and your Intelligence score increases by **1**.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed increases to **40** feet.

**Pack Tactics:** You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Sickle Claw:** As a bonus action, after you've moved at least 20 feet, you can make one attack with your Primal Savagery claw. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be knocked prone.

### Armored Titans (Thyreophora/Ceratopsian Type)
These Scamps are the living fortresses of the playground, combining the stubborn defense of an Ankylosaur with the charging might of a Triceratops. They are walking bulwarks, possessing bony frills, thick plating, and a stubborn refusal to be moved. When creating an Armored Titan, choose one of the following builds:

#### Fortress Build
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by an additional **2** (for a total of +4).

**Size:** Your size is **Large**.

**Defensive Plating:** Your Natural Armor is enhanced. Your base AC is **15 + your Dexterity modifier**.

**Tail Club:** You can use your action to swing your heavy, clubbed tail. Make a melee weapon attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes **2d6 + your Strength modifier** bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be stunned until the start of your next turn.

**Light Charge:** When you move at least 15 feet in a straight line toward a target and then hit it with a melee attack on the same turn, you can use your bonus action to shove the creature. If it fails a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), you can push it up to 10 feet away from you.

#### Charger Build
**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by **2**.

**Size:** Your size is **Large**.

**Light Plating:** Your Natural Armor is enhanced. Your base AC is **14 + your Dexterity modifier**.

**Goring Horns:** Your head is adorned with powerful horns. You can use your action to make a special attack with your horns. If you move at least 20 feet in a straight line toward a target right before making this attack, it deals **2d8 + your Strength modifier** piercing damage. On a successful hit, you can also use a bonus action to attempt to shove the target prone.

**Powerful Charge:** If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with your **Goring Horns** attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra **1d8 piercing damage**.
