Over the last 900 years, the academy has been a bulkwark of education against the misuse of power and an institution of consistent renown in the business of training up generations upon generations of
heroes and champions of just causes.

Here is an ever-expanding Timeline of Events

#### Pre Old-War Period

> - ***~1000 Years Ago:*** Academy Plane is established by the enigmatic figure known only as The Headmaster.
:
> - ***~900 Years Ago:*** The Headmaster teaches his first class, "Practical Adventuring." The class is so overbooked that the backlog to attend is estimated to be ~890 years long.

> - ***~850 Years Ago:*** The Headmaster disappears from everyday life amongs the Academy. Somehow, he continues to teach his classes as usual. In time, students forget they even take the class despite it appearing on their rosters and their earning of credits towards the class. Some students claim memories from these sessions with a Professor Hoots, but many dismiss these claims as some illusory trick of the Academy's latent magics.

> - ***~800 Years Ago:*** Sorceress Tabitha enrolls at the Academy at the age of 12, an orphan from a devastated and erased realm.

> - ***~770 Years Ago:*** Tabitha creates The Well of the Blessed Engine, a device she claims will allow her to save souls from outside the realm.

> - ***710-708 Years Ago:*** Sorceress Tabitha unleashes the true intent of the Well of Souls. Despite claiming it had never been turned on to full power to save the souls of those who died on other planes without some way to preserve the sanctity of their spirit, the device had been collecting and storing souls for almost a century. Using this power, Tabitha creates the first of her Warforged Host.

> - ***~707-705 Years Ago:*** Using the power of the Well and her Warforged Host, Tabitha wrests control of the Academy from The Council of Professorial Oversight which had taken over for the Headmaster after his sudden ontological dysfunction became apparent. Her pataphysical control over the Academic Plane becomes so strong that she is able to eject students and staff that pose any sort of threat to her hegemony.
>
> - Tabitha begins to recruit students not simply for the purpose of training but to harvest the failures for conversion into a part of her Warforged Host.

### The Old War Period
>- ***704-700 Years Ago:*** The First Internal Siege of Scholia Proper occurs. This represents the first attack on the Campus rendered by The Warforged Host. After finding a way to bring down the anti-lethality wards on the school, Tabitha sets out to reave the souls of the largest enrolled class since the opening of the Academy. Hundreds, if not thousands, die within the first few days of fighting in the small demiplane.
>

>- ***704 Years Ago:*** Pliya and dozens of other students are killed during the events of the First Internal Siege. Warforged emerge from beneath the school and ravage the campus- held back by bulwarks of remaining magical wards and the efforts of valiant students and staff who turn back the initial tide. Tabitha, Acting Headmistress, disappears from public view when scrutiny falls on her after the attack is repelled.

>- ***703 Years Ago*** Magiana and Lesser Radiana are consumed in magical fire and etheric nuclear flame as the Dragons of Monacalath are seen flying overhead in their first war formation in 200 years. They send message that this is a warning for the Academy to surrender to Tabitha's entourage. However, in burning the only lesser-protected spaces outside the grounds, Tabitha had also torched her own auspices of negotiation- war was now absolute and armies would march at The First Battle of the Gate in this year- Tabitha's armies, led by Monacalath the Dragon Lord and Sylane the Sister-Witch of the Sorceress, and the Scholian Forces led by Galander Forsythe and Ylva of the Circle of the Academy.
>- After weeks of slamming their forms against the Bulwark of the Gate, the Battle at the Doors takes place in the later days of this year. For a second time, Monacalath and Sylane are turned back from the Academy grounds they had once called home. The cost, Avatar of the Headmaster and another hero of the age are said to have held aloft the original doors of the school, using them as weapon and aegis against the foes of the Warforged Host.
>- At the Apex of Planar Power on The Eve of the New Year, The Mountains Mordest are levelled in an act of revenge after the loss of Galander Forsythe, Leader of Scholia Armies. Ylva made a pact with the spirits of nature bound to the Academy plane to destroy the mountains, dropping them into the planar void.

>- ***702 Years Ago:*** The Day the Mountains Tumbled results in the near-total annihilation of the Renegade Remnant of students under Tabitha, as well as eliminating most of The Training Fortress, which had been converted into The Ebony Echelon by Tabitha's forces.
>- The Iron March Begins as The Longest of Wintertide begins. Using Spatial Distortion magic fuelled by a last-ditch effort to tap the Well of Souls to defend against Tabitha, the Planar Demesne is drastically elongated in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The tension and stress of this action claims the lives of the entire Scholia Psionica and would mark the end of those studies at the Academy for almost 650 years.

#### The Middle War Period

**~699 Years Prior:**  
The Iron March concluded, and the Council of Professorial Oversight, now bolstered by the indomitable spirit of surviving heroes, reasserted its governance. The Well of the Blessed Engine, a once-proud bastion of innovation, was sealed, and the Academy embraced a new epoch of prudence and restraint in arcane research.

**~680 Years Prior:**  
The Academy, its reputation besmirched by the dark shadow of conflict, saw a dramatic decline in enrollment. In response, the Council broadened its admissions criteria, inviting pupils of diverse and unconventional backgrounds to walk its storied halls.

**~650 Years Prior:**  
The Great Library of Scholia, a bastion of erudition and the epicenter of academic endeavor, arose from the ashes of the past. It was enshrouded by an enchanted barrier, impermeable to those whose intentions were not pure.

**~630 Years Prior:**  
The Shadow Guild, a clandestine cabal of nefarious scholars and practitioners of the arcane, insinuated themselves into the very fabric of the Academy. Their machinations aimed to corrupt the youth and pilfer the school's ancient secrets.

**~600 Years Prior:**  
The Second Internal Siege of Scholia Proper was discovered as the Council unearthed a clandestine chamber within the Great Library, serving as the nexus of the Shadow Guild's operations. The ensuing battle cleansed the School of this malicious presence.

**~580 Years Prior:**  
In the wake of the Old War, the Academy introduced a novel curriculum centered on the study and safeguarding of ancient artifacts, recognizing the dual nature of power in the hands of the unenlightened.

The Diapered Defenders, a band of heroes known for their peculiar choice of emblematic attire, graduated from the Academy. Their legend grew as they championed humility and vulnerability in the face of adversity.

**~300 Years Prior:**  
The Great Schism rent the academic community asunder, as a contingent of traditionalists advocated for a return to the bygone era of the Well of Souls. The Council's intervention brought about a harmonious resolution, though echoes of discord lingered.

**~280 Years Prior:**  
The Outreach, a satellite campus of the Scholia Magus Academy, was established in the Material Plane, offering the fruits of knowledge to those unable to partake in the Planar Campus's ethereal embrace.

**~250 Years Prior:**  
The "Incontinence Incident," a regrettable prank gone awry, cast an embarrassing pall over the School. The ensuing hilarity and confusion, however, did little to deter the student body's resolve.

**~230 Years Prior:**  
The Council of Professorial Oversight was infiltrated by the descendants of the Shadow Guild. The Diapered Whisperer, a mole of insidious intent, began subtly shaping the Academy's destiny.
