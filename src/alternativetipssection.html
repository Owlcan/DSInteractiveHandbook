        <h2>How to Play: Naptime Adventures!</h2>
        <p>This section will guide you through the essentials of getting started, creating your character, understanding game mechanics, and using tools like Avrae. It’s your first step into becoming a legendary Diaper School adventurer!</p>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Before you can battle dragons (or maybe just very grumpy dust bunnies), there are a few things every Diaper School student needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Our Clubhouse: Discord!</strong> All our games, chats, and super-secret plans happen on Discord! It's like our magical treehouse, but with more dice and fewer splinters. Make sure you've joined our server to get all the latest news and find friends for your quests! <a href="[Link to Your Awesome Discord Server Here!]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Link to Your Awesome Discord Server Here!]</a></li>
                    <li><strong>Your Hero Storybook: Character Sheets!</strong> Every brave adventurer needs a storybook that tells everyone how amazing they are! This is your character sheet. You can make one using:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">D&D Beyond</a>: It's super easy, like coloring by numbers, and helps you keep track of all your cool powers!</li>
                            <li>Our Special <a href="[Link to Your GSheet Template Here]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheet Template</a>: This is another magic scroll that helps you build your hero!</li>
                        </ul>
                        Both are fantastic for showing off your character!
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Knowing Your D&D ABCs!</strong> We hope our little scholars have a little bit of D&D know-how – like what an Ability score is, how to be Brave in a fight, and the basics of Casting spells! If you're brand new to the big world of Dungeons & Dragons, think of it like learning how to use your building blocks before making a giant castle. Don't worry, there are lots of friendly grown-ups (Admins) and older students who are happy to help you learn the ropes!</li>
                </ul>

                Making Your Very Own Hero (with a Robot Helper!)
                <span class="arrow">&#9662;</span>
            </h3>
            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Sometimes, the bestest heroes are the ones you dream up all by yourself, with sparkly powers and cool outfits not found in the regular storybooks! This is called "homebrew," and it's like inventing your own super-duper flavor of ice cream!</p>
                <p>If you're using homebrew bits like a special race (maybe you're a Fluffy Cloud Kitten!) or a new class (like a Crayon Knight of Justice!), our grown-up helpers (Admins) need to give it a big thumbs up first. But don't fret! Making your character sheet can be as easy as 1-2-3-4 with a friendly robot helper (that's an AI Assistant!).</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Gather Your Sparkles!</strong> Collect all your notes, drawings, and ideas about your homebrew race, class, and any other special bits you want. It's like gathering all your favorite crayons and glitter before making a masterpiece!</li>
                    <li><strong>Tell the Robot Helper!</strong> Find your favorite AI assistant (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or another one – ask a grown-up if you need help finding one!). Show it all your notes. You can copy-paste the text or even upload files if your robot helper is extra smart!</li>
                    <li><strong>The Magic Words!</strong> Tell your robot helper this very special instruction. It's like a secret password to unlock a treasure chest of character creation!
                        <div class="h2p-codeblock">
                            <button class="h2p-copy-button" onclick="copyToClipboard(this)">Copy</button>
                            <code>Create a Level 5 D&D character with the provided materials. The character needs to have both the 2024 background option (which includes a feat and an Ability Score Increase - ASI) AND their normal racial ASI. Use the 27 point-buy method for ability scores, and make sure they have maximized Hit Points (HP) at every level. Please provide the character sheet in a document format if you can!</code>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Show and Tell Time!</strong> Once your robot helper has made your character sheet (poof!), bring it to the character approval channel on our Discord. Our Admin team will take a peek, ooh and aah, and help you get ready for your big adventures! Remember to check page 7 of the main handbook for general character creation rules, like "Hit Points MAXIMIZED Every Level" and "Level 5"!</li>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Imagine telling a super exciting story with your friends, but instead of talking out loud, you write it all down! That's "Play by Post" (or PbP for short). It's like passing secret notes in class, but with more dragons, fewer detentions, and definitely more diapers!</p>
                <p>We use our Discord clubhouse for PbP games. Because Discord is super speedy like a race car, our stories can zoom along much faster than old-fashioned forums, which were more like slow, sleepy snails. You can post when you have a moment – maybe during snack time, after school, or before bed – and the adventure keeps unfolding, one exciting message at a time!</p>

            <h3 class="h2p-accordion-header">Playground Rules: Being a Good Friend!<span class="arrow">&#9662;</span></h3>
            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>Even in a world filled with magic, monsters, and mountains of plushies, we all need to be good friends to each other. That's what roleplay etiquette is all about! It’s like sharing your toys, taking turns on the slide, and not throwing sand (unless it’s magic sand, and everyone agrees it’s okay!).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Remember the Code!</strong> Our Student Code of Conduct (you can find it on page 10 of the main handbook, little ones!) is super important. Being respectful, not cheating (that’s a big no-no!), and making sure everyone feels safe and happy are the golden rules of Diaper School.</li>
                    <li><strong>Think Before You Type!</strong> Before you post what your hero does or says, take a tiny pause. Is your character being kind (even if they're a grumpy barbarian)? Are you helping the story be fun for *everyone*? Teamwork makes the dream work, even when you're fighting giggling goblins!</li>
                    <li><strong>No Peeking! (Metagaming)</strong> Don't use grown-up knowledge that your little hero wouldn't actually know in the game. That's called "metagaming," and it's like peeking at someone else's drawing before they shout "Ta-da!"</li>
                    <li><strong>Consent is Cool!</strong> This is a big one, especially for things like punishments or certain types of roleplay (we talk about this on page 15 of the main handbook). Always make sure your playmates are comfy and having just as much fun as you are. If someone says "stop" or "I'm not comfortable," we listen!</li>

            <div class="h2p-accordion-content">
                <p>When you're roleplaying, you'll be doing all sorts of fantastically fun things! Casting super-duper spells, using amazing magical items, and taking brave actions that make everyone say "Wow!"</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Waving Your Wand (Magic!):</strong> Spells are like special instructions you give to the world, using funny words, wiggly hand gestures, or even sparkly dust! When you want your hero to cast a spell, describe what they do and say. Then, you'll use Avrae to see if your magic works its wonders. Remember, some spells need special bits and bobs (components)!</li>
                    <li><strong>Treasures and Trinkets (Items!):</strong> You'll find all sorts of amazing treasures! Magic swords that sing, potions that make you burp rainbows, and maybe even enchanted diapers (peek at "Da Big Diaper Chart" on page 66 of the main handbook!). When you want to use an item, just say so in your post.</li>
                    <li><strong>Doing Stuff (Actions in D&D!):</strong> In D&D, when it's your turn, you get to do an <strong>Action</strong>, maybe a <strong>Bonus Action</strong>, and <strong>Movement</strong>. Sometimes you get a <strong>Reaction</strong> even when it's not your turn! Describe your actions clearly and excitingly!</li>

                    <li><strong>Use Your Words (and Funny Voices!):</strong> Don't just say "I attack." Try: "Gronk the Brave roars, 'You won't get past me, you overgrown broccoli!' and swings his axe with all his might!"</li>
                    <li><strong>Show, Don't Just Tell (Like a Storybook!):</strong> Instead of "My character is sad," try: "A little tear rolled down Pip's cheek as he looked at his broken toy soldier."</li>

                    <li><strong>Super-Charged Character Creation:</strong> Ask for specific personalities, backstories, or help choosing abilities. Example tweak: "...create a Level 5 character... who is a shy but brave Kittenfolk from Whispering Woods, loves buttons, and wants to be a cookie baker. Ensure skills/feat reflect this for the Combat Academy setting."</li>

                            <li>Grid Marking & Image Recognition (Super Advanced!): Try showing AI a map image. "My hero (H) is by swings. Nannybot (M1) by slide moves to me. Show on grid?" (May not work perfectly).</li>
                            <li>Story Sparks: "Pip found a glowing, singing mushroom. Give 3 silly ideas if Pip eats/pokes/sings to it."</li>
