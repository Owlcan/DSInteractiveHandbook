# WADDLEHOOVES

Among the most ancient and steadfast residents of the Scholia Diaspros, the Waddlehooves are a robust and spirited centaurine race. It is said their ancestors trod the nascent lands of this very plane alongside Professor Horace Hootz himself, playing a pivotal role in the early exploration and shaping of the world under The Headmaster's guidance. Possessing a boundless energy and an insatiable curiosity akin to that of young ponies, Waddlehooves retain their zest for roaming and ranging throughout their lives, regardless of their specific clangroup or age. Hearty, capable, and naturally attuned to the rhythms of both the wild and the peculiar necessities of Diaper School, they are a common and cherished sight, their cheerful waddles and thundering gallops a familiar sound in the halls and fields.

Unlike many traditional centaur tales that speak of prideful reluctance to bear riders, Waddlehooves often exhibit a joyful willingness to share their strength and speed. They relish the opportunity to give playful horsey-rides to their smaller friends, readily offer their backs to aid tired or injured comrades, and, depending on their clangroup and individual prowess, some may even rise to become legendary mounts for truly capable and respected warriors. This cooperative spirit is a hallmark of their open and generous nature.

## WADDLEHOOVES TRAITS
Your Waddlehooves character has the following racial traits:

**Creature Type:** You are a Monstrosity (Centaur).

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Strength score increases by 4, and your Constitution score increases by 2.

**Age:** Waddlehooves mature at a rate similar to humans but are considered adults around 16. They live robust lives, often reaching 300 to 320 years. Their playful spirit, however, remains ageless.

**Alignment:** With their roaming nature and inherent curiosity, Waddlehooves lean towards chaotic or neutral alignments. Their strong community bonds and loyalty can also lead them towards good.

**Size:** Waddlehooves stand between 6 and 8 feet tall from hoof to head, with their equine bodies being proportionally large. Your size is Large.

**Speed:** Your base walking speed is 60 feet. You may choose to slow down and trot at the speed of your adventurers without exerting yourself.

**Swift Strider:** You can take the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn.

**Powerful Charge:** Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use for unarmed strikes. When you hit with a hoof attack, it deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + your Strength modifier. Additionally, if you move at least 30 feet straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack on the same turn, you can use your bonus action to make one hoof attack against the same target.

**Waddlehoof Kick:** As an action, you can deliver a powerful kick with your hooves. Make a melee attack roll using Strength against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage, and you can choose to push the target up to 10 feet away from you.

**Equine Build:** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet, instead of the normal 1 extra foot.

**Natural Incontinence:** Like many of the Scholia Diaspros's denizens, and true to their equine nature, Waddlehooves are naturally incontinent. Their bodies are simply not designed for prolonged control outside of their most primal needs. They are, however, remarkably adaptable and easily accustomed to the use of diapers, often seeing them as a practical part of life. This trait means you are considered Incontinent for the purposes of qualifying for feats like Diaper Mastery, if available in your campaign.

**Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. You also understand the specific Centaur dialect of Sylvan, which incorporates more whinnies, snorts, and hoof-stamping emphasis.

**Hoof-Bound Weapon Training:** You have proficiency with lances, shortbows, longbows, and armor crafted primarily from wood, vines, and other plant materials (such as Oaken Scale Mail or Vine Weave Armor, if available).

**Unbridled Gait:** Your four-legged form is built for efficient, sustained movement across vast distances. You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion caused by a forced march. Additionally, when traveling for an hour or more, your speed increases, allowing you to cover more ground. If you are carrying no more than a medium load, your overland travel pace is increased as shown in the Waddlehoof Overland Travel table.

This additional speed and pace assumes you are not stopping for combat or long breaks.

**Unyielding Endurance:** You have advantage on saving throws against exhaustion.

**Artisan's Knack:** You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice and proficiency in the Survival skill.

**Natural Diaper Mastery:** Burdenbearers are so accustomed to managing their bodily functions during their arduous labors that they have an innate understanding of their padding. You gain the Diaper Mastery feat (as described in the Diaper School Regulation Handbook, if available) at 1st level.

**Ability Score Increase:** Your Constitution score increases by an additional 2 (for a total of +4 Constitution from the base race).

### GROVEHOOF
Deeply connected to the ancient forests and wild magic of the plane, Grovehooves are the mystics, lorekeepers, and nature-wardens of their people. They possess an innate understanding of the land and its creatures.

**Ability Score Adjustment:** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, your Constitution score increases by an additional 2 (for a total of +4 Constitution from the base race), and your Strength score decreases by 2 (resulting in a net +2 Strength from the base race).

**Druidic Initiate:** You know one cantrip of your choice from the druid spell list. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast one 1st-level spell of your choice from the druid spell list once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

**Sylvan Knowledge:** You gain proficiency in the Nature skill. You also choose one from the following: proficiency in the Survival skill or proficiency with an herbalism kit. You have advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks related to identifying flora, fauna, and natural phenomena within your home plane.

**Pathfinder:** You can alwaysfind your way within any forest located on your home plane, even if you have never been there before, as long as the forest is not magically manipulated to prevent navigation. You can also communicate simple ideas with beasts and plants within such forests. They understand the meaning of your words, though you have no special ability to understand them in return. You have advantage on all Charisma checks you make to influence them.

**Animal Affinity:** Wild animals and non-predatory mundane beasts are naturally calm in your presence and will not attack you unless provoked or magically compelled. They may even show curiosity or approach you without fear.


======================================================================================
**NEW RACE**
======================================================================================
<h2>Diaparachnid</h2>
<p><i>“They wove the first banners of the Old War and the first diapers of the peace that followed. Their threads are woven into the very history of this Academy. Show them respect, for they are both cradle and warrior.”</i><br>- Professor Ardelie Heller</p>

<h3>The Ancient Weavers</h3>
<p>Among the oldest denizens of the Scholia Diaspros, the Diaparachnids are a race of sophisticated arachnoids whose history is inseparable from that of the Academy itself. In the ages before the Old War, it was the Diaparachnids who first perfected the art of weaving magical silks. Their many hands worked the looms that produced the first enchanted student uniforms, the resilient armor worn by the Academy’s defenders, and, as the needs of the realm evolved, the very first diapers designed to withstand the rigors of magical mishaps and extended nursery stays.</p>
<p>While their often-imposing appearance can be unnerving to other races, Diaparachnids are a deeply intellectual and industrious people, with a society built on intricate craftsmanship, communal living, and ancient traditions. They move with an unsettling grace, their multiple eyes missing no detail, their many arms capable of performing feats of complex artistry and martial prowess simultaneously. Though they come in many shapes—from the almost-humanoid to the centaur-like—all Diaparachnids share a common heritage as the master artisans and silent guardians of the deep places, their webs and halls forming a secret geography within and below the Academy.</p>

<h3>Diaparachnid Traits</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Creature Type:</strong> You are a Monstrosity.</li>
    <li><strong>Ability Score Adjustments:</strong> Your Diaparachnid character begins with the following base ability score adjustments before applying subrace modifications: Strength +2, Dexterity +2, Your choice of Intelligence or Constitution +2, Charisma -1.</li>
    <li><strong>Age:</strong> Diaparachnids mature at the same rate as humans but can live for several centuries.</li>
    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Diaparachnids' societies are built on order and tradition, leading them towards lawful alignments. However, their individual pursuits can lead them anywhere on the spectrum.</li>
    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Your size is determined by your subrace.</li>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</li>
    <li><strong>Arachnovision:</strong> You have a superior, multi-faceted perception of the world. You have Blindsight to a range of 30 feet, Darkvision to a range of 120 feet, and lowlight vision to 300ft.</li>
    <li><strong>Spiderwalking:</strong> All Diaparachnids can climb up vertical surfaces, but only those with a robust spider morphology or small size can walk upon the ceilings of rooms and surfaces. Slick or slippery surfaces pose the same challenge to walk upon, but result in falling and possible damage if a spiderling loses their footing on these surfaces. A spiderling does not suffer these disadvantages inside the vicinity of their webbing, no matter their size.</li>
    <li><strong>Many-Armed:</strong> You have six arms. You can use your extra arms to interact with objects, provide the Help action to up to three persons within five feet of them at one time, or perform other tasks, but you cannot use them to wield additional weapons or shields in combat. You can prepare spells or perform manual crafting tasks in half the time.</li>
    <li><strong>Webspinning:</strong> All Diaparachnids can perform some manner of web-spinning- and can, at the very least, create a simple trap or secure hammock at will provided they are adequately fed and have 1 hour to construct the web. The web should function as a permanent trap or temporary rest placing lasting for 24 hours, during such time any creature other than the Diaparachnid that enters or touches the area of the web must succeed on a dexterity saving throw or have their movement speed halved. The web has an AC of 10 and 15 hit points. The web can be moved with an action, but after it has been used to engulf a prey item or has existed for 24 hours, its properties degrade and it is no longer a viable web. Additionally, once per long rest, you can spend 1 hour to spin webbing into diapers. You can create either two diapers sized for your specific Diaparachnid morphology or five diapers sized for a Medium creature. These diapers have 4 use charges, plus a number of additional charges equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 0).</li>
    <li><strong>Arachnincontinence:</strong> Ages living in the Diaper School realm and producing magical and mundane diapers have led all but the rarest of Diaparachnids to be lifelong diaper-wearers. At creation Diaparachnids are considered Incontinent as per the trait for the purpose of qualifying for taking the diaper-mastery feat if offered. Diaparachnids must ensure they have diapers suited for their morphology- be that a prominent spinneret or a full spider-like lower-half.</li>
    <li><strong>Languages:</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spider Morphology</h3>
<p>Spiderfolk take many forms. A player can be fully anthropomorphic, something akin to a spidertaur, or any blending of spider and human insofar as their general appearance is concerned. It should be noted that exotic body-types require exotic armor (and diapers).</p>

<hr class="gold-divider">
<h3>Diaparachnid Subraces</h3>
<p>The Diaparachnids are divided into several clades, each with distinct adaptations and roles within their vibrant society.</p>
<hr class="gold-divider">

<h4><strong>Padded Pouncers</strong></h4>
<hr class="gold-divider">
<p class="subrace-description">Inspired by the vibrant and agile jumping spiders, these are the artists, diplomats, and dancers of Diaparachnid society. Their surprisingly endearing, multi-eyed faces make them the most approachable of their kind.</p>

</ul>
<hr class="gold-divider">

<h4><strong>Silkswaddlers</strong></h4>
<hr class="gold-divider">
<p class="subrace-description">Drawing their lineage from massive, powerful tarantulas, Silkswaddlers are the builders and laborers of the Diaparachnids. They are immensely strong, capable of producing thick, incredibly durable silk used for construction and clothing.</p>

    <li><strong>Size:</strong> Large.</li>
    <li><strong>Dig Speed:</strong> You have a burrowing speed of 15 feet through dirt, sand, and loose rock.</li>
    <li><strong>Fortress Weaving:</strong> Your webs are twice the size of other Diaparachnids' and are harder to break (double HP).</li>
    <li><strong>Artisan Weaver:</strong> You can produce clothing from your silk and use purchased or created components to turn them into permanent clothing items.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="gold-divider">

<h4><strong>Nursery Nightweavers</strong></h4>
<hr class="gold-divider">
<p class="subrace-description">Embodying the lethal patience and terrifying speed of huntsman spiders, these Diaparachnids are the preeminent scouts and assassins of their people. They move with a chilling silence and are masters of the ambush.</p>

<hr class="gold-divider">
<p class="subrace-description">A rare and hardy offshoot, these Diaparachnids are believed to be the result of a magical catastrophe that merged Diaparachnid and scorpion bloodlines. They are ferocious survivalists who have traded prolific silk-weaving for potent venom.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Your base walking speed is 40 feet.</li>
    <li><strong>Stinging Tail:</strong> You have a natural tail weapon that deals decent damage and is a finesse weapon.</li>
    <li><strong>Envenom:</strong> You can envenomate your tail a number of times per day equal to your Constitution bonus plus proficiency. Poison damage can be enhanced by assassin-subclass skills if available.</li>
    <li><strong>Antivenom Synthesis:</strong> You can expend 2 uses of your venom to produce an antivenin that will work on any poison crafted by a brewer of equal or lower level than you.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="gold-divider-biggo">
