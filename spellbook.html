    <h2>Padded Arcana</h2>
    <p>In the realm of magic there are outlets and studies for every desire, interest, and proclivity. From conjuring sweets, to summoning friends, to creating tools and items- magic is pretty neat! And so, yes, of course, there is magic solely designed for ABDL tasks, causes and needs. Many are diaper and diaper-use focused, but others are aesthetic or even have obvious utility in the big scary world!</p>

Deodorize or Scent: You neutralize undesirable odors on an object or creature, or imbue them with an enchanting fragrance reminiscent of fresh baby powder, warm milk, or blossoming garden flowers. Heating/Chilling (with Gentle Massage): You alter the temperature of an object or creature so that it becomes pleasantly warm or cool. If you target a creature, you may opt to provide a gentle, soothing massage along with the temperature change. When you do, the recipient gains advantage on its next saving throw against effects that would instill fear or panic. Flavoring: You imbue a morsel of food or a drink with a subtle burst of flavor, heightening its comforting qualities. Soothing Care: You channel a gentle magic that alleviates minor aches, pains, and the discomfort of mild fatigue. Choose one creature within range; for the duration, that creature feels a soothing alleviation of bodily discomfort, granting it advantage on ability checks and saving throws related to minor pain or fatigue. This effect does not restore hit points. Furthermore, if the target remains under the uninterrupted effect of Soothing Care for an entire short rest, and it is suffering from exhaustion at level 1, that level of exhaustion is removed at the end of the rest. Only one effect can be active per casting, and the chosen miracle persists for the spell's duration or until you invoke a different effect with this cantrip. While not a substitute for potent restorative magic, Little Miracle reflects the tender, task-focused character of divine care in Diaper School."

These images impose a chance for enemies to hit them instead of you. An attacker must roll to see if they hit an image; images are destroyed when hit. This lasts 1 minute.\n\nEcho Duplicate: By spending **3 points**, you summon a single semi-real duplicate (made of shadow or light) in an unoccupied space within 15 ft.

You can move it on your turn (up to 30 ft) and you can mentally swap places with it as a bonus action (teleporting both of you, no limit on uses, akin to Echo Knight’s switch). You can also make attacks from the duplicate’s position when you take the Attack action (essentially extending your melee reach or angle).
