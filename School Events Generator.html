        { "title": "Hot Cocoa Social", "description": "The dorm is hosting a hot cocoa night with extra-large servings.

        { "title": "Prankster's Revenge", "description": "Someone has enchanted the common room furniture to emit a subtle 'Bladder Weakness' aura.

                { "title": "Emergency Simulation", "description": "A surprise emergency drill requires students to evacuate to the basement shelter.

                { "title": "Dorm Pet Adoption", "description": "The dorm has adopted a 'Puddle Sprite' as a mascot, but it's causing random wet spots to appear around the common areas.

                { "title": "Anniversary Celebration", "description": "It's the 50th anniversary of the dorm building. To celebrate, current students are required to wear period-appropriate diapers from the founding era - much thicker and more conspicuous than modern designs. Roll 1d12: On a 1, one of the historical diapers is actually 'The Attention Magnet Diaper' from the archives, making the wearer impossible to ignore." },
                { "title": "Magical Experiment Gone Wrong", "description": "A student's thaumaturgy experiment has backfired, creating a field of uncontrolled magic in their room.
